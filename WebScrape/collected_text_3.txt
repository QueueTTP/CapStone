Kate Beckinsale Attends First Event Since Mystery Illness, Hospitalization
By Logan DeLoye

May 3, 2024

Kate Beckinsale recently attended her first public event since being hospitalized for a "mysterious illness" in March.

According to Page Six, the beloved British actress stepped out at the King’s Trust 2024 Global Gala in New York City on Thursday night (May 2) following a weeks-long hospital stay for a medical issue that was not disclosed to the public.

The 50-year-old standout donned a white tule gown for the event, featuring tall pumps and an updo complete with her signature black bow. Page Six mentioned that Beckinsale posted multiple photos throughout the entirety of her hospital stay in March, a few featuring a similar-looking bow to the one she wore to the gala.

On March 11th, she shared a handful of snaps to her story honoring her mother, Judy Loe, for U.K. Mother’s Day (March 10), with a "cryptic" message that read:

"Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s s–t and try to make sure there are some bits that aren’t. And for looking after our dogs when we can’t, and lead us to remember happy things when we can’t. And turn up when we are sick and sit with us … And send balloons and check in and pull us out of wells with love.”
All the photos taken during the actresses hospital stay have since been deleted from her Instagram page. Despite multiple celebrity friends and concerned followers commenting on her posts asking what was wrong with her, Beckinsale never revealed a diagnosis. In spite of recent mystery surrounding her condition, the icon did post a photo on April 11th wearing a shirt that said “Tummy Troubles Survivor,” leading fans to believe that she was hospitalized for stomach issues.

George Strait is a ready for another round.

The country legend used the platform of his concert at Lucas Oil Stadium, the home of NFL franchise Indianapolis Colts, to announce Cowboys And Dreamers (via MCA), his 31st studio album.

According to reps, more than 51,000 filled out the stadium for Strait’s two-hour performance on Saturday, May 4. “We got some new stuff, too, I’m gonna throw in throughout the night, because I broke down and did another record, and I’m gonna play a few of those for you tonight,” he told the audience.

The 71-year-old Texas native shared several new songs from the forthcoming album, including “Three Drinks Behind,” and was joined by Chris Stapleton on two numbers, “Honky Tonk Hall of Fame” and “You Don’t Know What You’re Missing”.

Trending on Billboard

01:02





The Indianapolis date was one of just 10 shows Strait will perform in 2024, and marked a return to the stage following a string of devastating losses to his industry family including his manager of nearly 50 years, Eugene Ervine “Erv” Woolsey, Ace in the Hole member Gene Elders, and tour manager Tom Foote.

“It’s so good to be back,” he said from the stage, “man, it’s been six months, and that’s too long.”

Paying tribute to his lost friends, Strait remarked, “The last couple of months have been a tough time… music makes it all better. Thank you for coming out – we’ve had a great time tonight,” he said, as he closed out a six-song encore in their honor.

The County Music Hall of Famer and three-times CMA entertainer of the year has had a remarkable career, during which he has notched 44 Billboard Hot Country Songs chart-toppers, a record-tying 61 Country Airplay top 10s, and a record 27th No. 1s on Top Country Albums Chart, most recently with Honky Tonk Time Machine.

Strait’s 2024 Concert Calendar:
May 4 — Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, IN
May 11 –EverBank Stadium, Jacksonville, FL
May 25 — Jack Trice Stadium, Ames, IA
June 1 — Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte, NC
June 8 — MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, NJ
June 15 — Kyle Field, College Station, TX
June 29 — Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City, UT
July. 13 — Ford Field, Detroit, MI
July 20 — Soldier Field, Chicago, IL
Dec. 7 — Allegiant Stadium, Las Vegas, NV

The Indianapolis date was one of just 10 shows Strait will perform in 2024, and marked a return to the stage following a string of devastating losses to his industry family including his manager of nearly 50 years, Eugene Ervine “Erv” Woolsey, Ace in the Hole member Gene Elders, and tour manager Tom Foote.

“It’s so good to be back,” he said from the stage, “man, it’s been six months, and that’s too long.”

Paying tribute to his lost friends, Strait remarked, “The last couple of months have been a tough time… music makes it all better. Thank you for coming out – we’ve had a great time tonight,” he said, as he closed out a six-song encore in their honor.

The County Music Hall of Famer and three-times CMA entertainer of the year has had a remarkable career, during which he has notched 44 Billboard Hot Country Songs chart-toppers, a record-tying 61 Country Airplay top 10s, and a record 27th No. 1s on Top Country Albums Chart, most recently with Honky Tonk Time Machine.
