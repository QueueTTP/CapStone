BIRTHDAY STAR: Actor Sabrina Carpenter was born in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, on this date in 1999. This birthday star portrayed Maya Hart on “Girl Meets World” from 2014 – 2017. She also voiced the role of Melissa Chase on “Milo Murphy’s Law.” Carpenter’s film resume includes roles in “Tall Girl 2,” “Emergency,” and “Clouds.” Besides acting, she also sings with her albums including the 2022 release Emails I Can’t Send.

ARIES (March 21-April 19): It’s possible that your trusted friends and reliable companions may be on your mind just as you could be on theirs. An impulsive purchase or unexpected gift could turn out to be more enjoyable than you imagined.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Discover your own path in life despite any fears that may be coming up. Your unique outlook could attract more attention than usual. Enjoy the special treatment and recognition that may come as a result of being your true self.

CANCER (June 21-July 22): A spontaneous conversation may lead to a wise professional move or a profitable project. Since you could be in good harmony with your favorite person, an unexpected change of plans should be unlikely to spoil any weekend adventures.

IF MAY 11 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: Your professionalism and practical expertise may shine brightly during the upcoming two to three weeks. Consider implementing key financial strategies while your common sense and skills may be at their peak. You could be impacted by emotional issues or struggle to make decisions in June. Wait until July to think about following your fantasies; perhaps take a vacation or get away for a weekend with someone close. Your social calendar could fill up quickly in August when your networking efforts could pay off with some extra invitations. Wait until late September or early October, when your reputation may be enhanced, to consider applying for a new opportunity or putting a new product out into the public view. That could be when your most attractive qualities are more obvious and you might be able to make firm commitments that reflect well on your public image.

Is Saturday Night Live New Tonight, May 11, 2024?
Is Saturday Night Live new or a repeat tonight? Here's everything to know about the May 11 episode's Host and Musical Guest.

By Samantha Vincenty May 11, 2024, 12:00 AM ET
Last week, pop star Dua Lipa lit up Studio 8H as Saturday Night Live's May 4 Host and Musical Guest  Lipa performed "Illusion" and "Happy For You" from her Radical Optimism album and starred in hilarious sketches, including an unexpected tribute to a certain pasta dish.

How to Watch
Watch Saturday Night Live Saturdays at 11:30/10:30c on NBC and next day on Peacock.  

"It is just the most incredible experience I've ever been through. It's just been such a thrilling journey," the "Houdini" singer told WNBC’s Adam Kuperstein as she prepped for the big night.  

Lipa's episode was the first since Ryan Gosling's wildly successful third stint as Host, which featured a sketch so popular, Gosling and Mikey Day resurrected the characters on The Fall Guy premiere's red carpet. All in all, it's been a fantastic 49th season for the long-running sketch show — and there are only two episodes left!

Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's Relationship Timeline
These two love a PDA-filled moment.

By Christina Perrier  Updated on June 27, 2024 @ 01:34PM

Sabrina Carpenter is Barry Keoghan's shot of "Espresso." Ever since the pair got together in December 2023, their budding romance has been just as flirty and steamy as her seductive pop hit. And like she sings in the top-charting single, Carpenter seems to have popped into the actor's life and "dream came trued it for" him, as many of their sweet, PDA-filled public moments see Keoghan looking like a man in love.

From their stylish chance encounter at Paris Fashion Week to their swoon-worthy Met Gala debut, see how their adorable relationship has evolved.

September 28, 2023: Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan meet at Paris Fashion Week.

Carpenter and Keoghan had their first meeting in style, as they were reportedly introduced to each other at the Givenchy Spring/Summer 2024 runway show during Paris Fashion Week.

December 2, 2023: They spark romance rumors.
The pair is captured grabbing dinner together in Los Angeles in photos published to Daily Mail. For their speculated date, Carpenter opted for an edgy fit consisting of baggy jeans, a button down shirt, a glossy black leather trench coat, and matching chunky boots, while Keoghan looked cozy in a beige collared knit sweater and jeans.

January 2024: They go on a bunch of cute dates.

Eagle-eyed fans went to work in January tracking the star couple's whereabouts. On one occasion, they were spotted attending an art gallery in coordinated sleek black looks.

On another, as reported by People, they were seen at L.A. theme park Luna Luna. For this outing, Carpenter looked flirty in a pink ruffled minidress and oversize leather jacket, and Keoghan looked suave in dark jeans and a matching bomber jacket. An onlooker told the publication "it definitely seemed like a date" and they "shared a little kiss."

February 4, 2024: They soft launch their relationship at the Grammys after-party.

Carpenter and Keoghan made their public couple debut at W Magazine's Grammys after-party. Although they arrived separately, the publication shared a photo of the two getting cozy during the fête. In it, Keoghan, clad in a blue sweater, covers his mouth with one hand and rests the other on Carpenter's leg; meanwhile, the singer, looking angelic in a semi-sheer white dress, cheekily covers her face with a martini glass.

February 9, 2024: They enjoy a fun, PDA-filled night out.
In case there was any lingering speculation, Carpenter and Keoghan sealed the deal when they enjoyed a hot date in February. They were seen grabbing dinner at Nobu before heading to cocktail lounge Ysabel and sharing a kiss outside Hotel Bel-Air. The singer served up some date night outfit inspo in a sleeveless black minidress with a mock neckline, paired with sheer tights and a black leather blazer. Meanwhile, Keoghan oozed cool in a red bomber jacket layered over a white T-shirt and paired with khaki pants.

March 3, 2024: Barry Keoghan supports Sabrina Carpenter at her Eras tour show.


Keoghan traveled all the way to Singapore to show his love for Carpenter, who was performing as the opening act of Taylor Swift's Eras tour. Videos posted to social media capture the actor looking like a man in love as he watched his girl from the audience with the biggest grin on his face. Later, the couple shared an embrace backstage.

March 10, 2024: They make their red carpet debut at the Oscars.

What better place to hard launch your relationship than the Oscars, which is exactly what Carpenter and Keoghan did. They basically broke the internet with one photo, which shows Carpenter wrapping her arm around Keoghan's neck as they each cover the bottom half of their face with their hand. In a sweet tribute to Carpenter, Keoghan accented his black tweed jacket and dark trousers with a friendship bracelet adorned with a pink heart charm and beads that spelled out her name.


To make things even cuter, Carpenter looked incredible in a semi-sheer Tory Burch gown and, like the rest of us, Keoghan could not keep his eyes off of her. A video posted to TikTok shows the Irish actor looking over at Carpenter as she poses on the red carpet.

Keoghan is every inch the supportive boyfriend as he attended another one of Carpenter's concerts, this time at Coachella Valley Music Festival. In videos posted to social media, the actor is seen lovingly gazing at, cheering for, and videotaping Carpenter as she does her set. And his dedication didn't go unnoticed by the singer; she had quite the treat in store for Keoghan, which came in the form of her "Nonsense" outro.

She remixed her lyrics and sang, “Man his knees so weak, he had to spread mine / He’s drinkin’ my bath water like it’s red wine," nodding to that scene from Keoghan's movie Saltburn. “Coachella, see you back here when I headline,” she closed out the tribute.


Later in the day, they enjoyed a double date with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce at Ice Spice's show.

As if fashion's biggest night wasn't packed with enough standout style serves and unforgettable moments, Keoghan and Carpenter shut the whole place down by making their Met Gala debut in seemingly coordinated Alice in Wonderland-inspired looks. Carpenter looked like a real-life princess in a strapless black velvet gown that featured a puffy baby blue skirt, while Keoghan looked dapper in an espresso-colored velvet suit, fanciful white shirt, black top hat, and matching dress shoes. The two looked smitten as they posed for photos together.

Carpenter turned 25 a few days after her Met Gala debut with celebrations all coordinated by her boyfriend, Keoghan. The "Espresso" singer wore a butter yellow silk dress inspired by the gown Kate Hudson donned in her iconic early aughts rom-com, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days.


June 6, 2024: Barry Keoghan makes a cameo in Sabrina Carpenter's "Please Please Please" music video.
Carpenter dropped the video for "Please Please Please" on June 6, in which she plays ultra-glam 1980s mob wife–and we're here for it. But Carpenter didn't act alone: she was joined by her boyfriend Keoghan, making this the couple's first-ever professional collaboration.

“He loved the song," Carpenter told Variety. "He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that,” she says. “I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation. So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”

The video begins with Carpenter in jail, but she's soon bailed out. As she's leaving, Keoghan is led inside in handcuffs. So begins an epic romance between the two that doesn't exactly have a happy ending. “I heard that you’re an actor," Carpenter sings. "So act like a stand up guy.”
