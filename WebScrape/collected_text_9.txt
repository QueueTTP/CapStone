My Official Pitches For Sabrina Carpenter's 'SNL' "Nonsense" Outro
By Ilana Frost | May 08, 2024
Comments
I managed to gatekeep Sabrina Carpenter for about seven years, but unfortunately for me, the girls have finally discovered her and made her a Main Pop Girlie. (So thrilled they’ve done the same to Chappell Roan and Renee Rapp. Yay.) Given her newfound approaching-A-list stardom, I won’t be able to afford any more Sabrina concert tickets, so I’ll have to settle for catching her late night TV performances. Honestly though, I’m SO excited for the “Espresso” queen to make her Saturday Night Live debut. The mini blonde has a five-octave vocal range, dance training, and a very effective Irish muse named Barry Keoghan. She knows how to write a bop and put on a damn good show. Plus, Jake Gyllenhaal’s hosting, so maybe she can get Tall Blondie’s scarf back.

ADVERTISEMENT
We’re all thinking the same thing: What’s Sabrina’s SNL “Nonsense” outro gonna be? Well, I actually don’t have to ask that question because I’ve come up with every possible answer myself. And I happen to think my ideas are rather genius and hilarious. Here are my theories about Sabrina’s upcoming performance and my official pitches for her SNL-themed “Nonsense” outro. Call me, Sab.


ADVERTISEMENT
Which Songs Will Sabrina Carpenter Perform On SNL?

My educated guesses are “Nonsense” and “Espresso.” She couldn’t possibly go on SNL and NOT do an iconic “Nonsense” outro. And fans and celebs alike are already calling “Espresso” the song of the summer, so that’s a given. Hey, ya never know… maybe she’ll sing “Skin” just to be a little messy. JK, JK, just because Joshua Bassett is singing about his Olivia-Sabrina love triangle drama again doesn’t mean we should all rehash it. Protect your peace, people.

My Official Pitches For Sabrina Carpenter’s SNL “Nonsense” Outro
He said please come over I said hell no / I’m too busy serving me espresso / Maybe after I crush SNL though
Yes, I’m a huge fan of “All Too Well” / But this opportunity is too swell / Jake I’ll have to fight you after SNL 
Swifties, please don’t sound the death knell / Believe me I am in Jake Gyllenhell / But I’ll do anything for SNL
He eats me out like I’m Irish soda bread / I told him good work now you can go to bed / He said nah I’ll watch SNL instead
“That’s that me espresso” is my slogan / It works real well on Barry Keoghan / SNL you’re sexy like my Irishman
ADVERTISEMENT
Sabrina Carpenter’s Actual SNL Outro
Stay tuned to see “Nonsense” (SNL Version) when Sabrina makes her SNL debut on May 18! She’s not gonna play around at 30 Rock, so it will probably be her most memorable one yet.

Last Looks: Sabrina Carpenter & Barry Keoghan
About
Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan have made their Met Gala debut, wearing two wildly different looks. The couple arrived at New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art during the mid-evening, with Keoghan wearing a seemingly Wonka-inspired Burbarry Burberry tuxedo that's, coincidentally, an extremely earthy brown. Some might say… espresso-colored? Carpenter, on the other hand, wore a gown with a black bodice and a train that resembled the sky and the clouds. They snapped a pic together at the top of the Met stairs, with Keoghan's hand resting on Carpenter's waist.

Special guest.

[Sabrina gasps]

Hey, what's up Vogue?

[people laughing]

[jazz music]

Today is the MET, the first Monday of May,

the most important time of the year.

One of Sabrina's beauty icons

is the lovely fantastic, the sexy Brigitte Bardot.

I think there's this perfect merge

of like romance and edge, which is quintessential Sabrina.

You have this like toughness up top

which is this beautiful crushed velvet

that's corsetting in.

And then you kind of fall into this cloud of magic

that will be surrounded her whole entire body,

so it's like a duchess satin at the bottom

that has been like literally

Fernando from Oscar de la Renta,

like actually spray painted the bottom of this dress.

So Sabrina's amazing.

Colorist Lori made her hair color lighter,

much more icy, which I'm really excited about,

so that's gonna just like really pop on the carpet.

It's just gonna be super romantic, fluffy, '60's vibes,

we always love to lean into the '60's era.

Feeling good.

It's getting closer, so you know what means,

thinking lots of things right now, some good,

some terrifying, some light, some dark, it's good.

I'm wearing custom Oscar de la Renta,

and I'm very very honored and excited.

This is only my second MET Gala,

so it was very very exciting

that I'd get to be able to collaborate with Fernando

and the whole team of Oscar.

Initially the dress was a lot of different colors.

I think he was pulling from a lot of different collections,

and a lot of just different inspiration.

And he saw these flowers that I had in my living room,

they were forget me nots, they were this like baby blue,

and they're really beautiful.

And we both looked at the flower we were just like,

I think it's that, I think it's this color.

[jazz music]

I feel really overwhelmed, and grateful, and excited.

And you know the amount of times now

that I've had shots of espresso

it's like I'm over caffeinated,

so I am, I feel very very lucky.

Are we gonna do a little espresso shot?

Work.

We love espresso.

[Scott laughs]

Thank you guys

for meme-ifying my song in the bets way possible,

and supporting it, and streaming it.

I love writing songs,

it's been my greatest love since I was a little girl.

Maybe next time it won't be about coffee,

maybe it'll be about something else, we'll find out.

Vogue, I'm low key in a rush, so I really have to go, bye.

[jazz music]

[people talking indistinctly]

Special guest.

[Sabrina gasps]

Oh.

I'm not allowed to curse? Not allowed to curse.

[Sabrina laughs]

Hey.

I love this.

What's up Vogue?

[everyone laughs]

Thanks Vogue, thanks for watching.

Thanks Vogue, see you later.

So good to see you, bye.

Sabrina Carpenter Is Working Late -- For Marc Jacobs
Spotlighting the signature Sack bag in the new Pre-Fall 2024 campaign.
It-girl of the moment Sabrina Carpenter features in Marc Jacobs‘ new Pre-Fall 2024 campaign, shot in Los Angeles and styled by Alastair McKimm. Fresh off the back of her Coachella performance and Met Gala couple debut, the singer-songwriter teamed up with Marc Jacobs to spotlight the signature Sack bag in a range of new hues.

Featuring bright pink, lilac, black and white colorways in different sizes, the campaign sees Carpenter wearing the new editions with some of Marc Jacobs’ signature apparel. The bag made its debut during Marc Jacobs’ Fall 2022 runway show and has since gone on to become one of the brand’s new icons, crafted from lightweight full-grain leather in mini, small and large sizes.

Take a look at Carpenter in action for Marc Jacobs above and head to the brand’s website for a closer look at the new season colorways and styles.

While you’re here, check out the newest sneaker loafer on the block — courtesy of PUMA and Palomo Spain.

Kim Kardashian’s Daughter North West Lands 'First Major Performance' Role
By Logan DeLoye

May 8, 2024

North West has just landed her first big role as part of an upcoming Disney+ special scheduled to take place at the end of the month. According to E!News, the 10-year-old standout will play a character in "Disney's The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl," a live performance taking place on May 24th and 25th.

North, daughter to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, will join an exciting playbill of The Lion King alums who took part in the production of the original film in 1994. Jeremy Irons, who played Scar, Nathan Lane, who played Timon, Ernie Sabella, who played Pumba, and Jason Weaver, who played young Simba, are just a few of many talented actors set to showcase their skills at the live event during Memorial Day weekend.

More recent Lion King alums such as Billy Eichner, who played Timone in the live-action version of the film in 2019, and Broadway's The Lion King Musical actors Heather Headley, who played Nala, and Bradley Gibson who played Simba, will join North on stage at the highly-anticipated Hollywood Bowl performance.

As if the star-studded lineup detailed above was not impressive enough, the show will also feature Academy Award winner Jennifer Hudson! E!News mentioned that Disney+ plans to stream the special following the live event, but a date has yet to be announced. The exciting special will feature original songs from the film including "Hakuna Matata," and "Can You Feel The Love Tonight," backed by a glorious orchestra.

North is extremely passionate about music and in March, revealed that she would be dropping her first album titled "Elementary School Dropout" (a nod to her father's album,The College Dropout, released in 2004) very soon as she continues to follow in her parent's footsteps. Her exact role in "Disney's The Lion King at the Hollywood Bowl," has yet to be revealed as the world waits in anticipation for the event!
