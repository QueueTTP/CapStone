05/19/2024
The 25-year-old pop star made her musical guest debut on Saturday Night Live, performing her Billboard Hot 100 chart top 10 song “Espresso,” along with a medley of “Feather” and “Nonsense.”

The season 49 finale on May 18 was hosted by Jake Gyllenhaal, who returned in the role for the third time.

For her first musical performance, Carpenter donned a red minidress while delivering her hit single “Espresso” on a bar-themed set. The theatrical performance included the backing of a full band and dancers male dressed as in black and white suits.

“Espresso” has spent four straight weeks in the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart after logging the best debut of the the singer’s career, getting meme’d in countless ways and setting off dance parties at Coachella.

Carpenter returned later in the episode for a medley of “Feather” and “Nonsense,” which appear on her 2023 album, Emails I Can’t Send. In honor of her SNL musical guest debut, the singer changed the lyrics to “Nonsense,” singing before the chorus, “I’m on SNL and you’re not.”

Carpenter has spent much of her time recently as an opener for Taylor Swift on the superstar’s global Eras Tour, playing stadiums in Latin America, Australia and Singapore.

Elsewhere during the show, Carpenter appeared alongside Gyllenhaal in a pre-taped Scooby Doo-themed skit playing the character Daphne.

Sabrina Carpenter customized her songs specifically for her first–ever Saturday Night Live performance — and appeared in a sketch, to boot.

Even before her first performance on the May 18 episode, Sabrina appeared in a pre-filmed sketch called Scooby Doo and the Mystery of the Shadow Phantom, which cast her as Daphne opposite host Jake Gyllenhaal‘s Freddie, Mikey Day‘s Shaggy, Sarah Sherman‘s Velma and a CGI Scooby Doo. They unmasked the bad guy, but then things got super-dark, disgusting and bloody. Everyone ended up dead, except Daphne.

For her first performance, Sabrina sang her massive hit “Espresso,” which began with her sitting in a bar reading a newspaper. The headline read “Sabrina Loves to Be On Top!,” with another story headlined, “That ‘Me Espresso’ Sparks Debate on Literacy.”  She then performed the song while two male dancers pretended to fight over her, and changed the f-word to “damn.”

Her second performance was a mash-up of “Feather” and “Nonsense.” When she got to the line in “Feather” that goes “I got you blocked, excited to never talk / I, I’m so sorry for your loss,” she changed it to “I got you blocked / excited to never talk / I, I’m on SNL and you’re not!”

She then transitioned into the outro of “Nonsense,” and as usual, she added some event-specific lyrics. Although they’re a bit too suggestive to quote, you can see the performance on YouTube.

Tony nominee Jake Gyllenhaal hosted the May 18 episode of Saturday Night Live with musical guest Sabrina Carpenter, who made her Broadway debut in Mean Girls shortly before its pandemic closure. Watch Gyllenhaal channel a mix of Cabaret’s Emcee and Chicago’s Billy Flynn in the Follies parody above, in an ode to painfully average men inspired by the Stephen Sondheim song "Beautiful Girls.”

Gyllenhaal was last seen on Broadway in 2019 in Nick Payne and Simon Stephens' Sea Wall/A Life. His performance earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play.


The actor can sing. He previously starred in the title role of the 2017 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's Sunday in the Park with George, and played Roland in Payne's Constellations in 2015. 

As a founder of Nine Stories Productions, Gyllenhaal also co-produced Sea Wall/A Life, Sunday in the Park with George, and 2020 Best Play Tony nominee Slave Play. 

Gyllenhaal is set to star as Iago opposite Denzel Washington's Othello in the upcoming Kenny Leon-helmed Broadway revival. Performances are expected to begin in spring 2025.

Sabrina Carpenter’s Psyched About Adele’s Praise for ‘Espresso’: ‘Adele Thinks About Me in Bed’
The ubiquitous single is the 25-year-old singer’s first top 10 hit in both the U.S. and U.K.

During her Las Vegas show Saturday night, Adele took a few minutes to heap praise on Sabrina Carpenter’s song “Espresso.” The “Rolling in the Deep” singer shared that after she got back to her hotel and into bed late the night before, she found herself singing the lyrics, “I’m working late, ’cause I’m a singer.”

Carpenter retweeted an article about the moment and captioned it, “all i read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.”


The same night Adele was sharing her “Espresso” love with her audience, Carpenter performed the song on “Saturday Night Live”:


“Espresso” was released in April and has been dubbed one of the songs of the summer. In an interview with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe, Carpenter explained of the track, “There was something really exciting about the fact that there was so much personality throughout the entire song, because those are the ones that are really, really fun to sing live with a crowd.”

“Those are the ones that people, I think when they don’t know my music or who I am or anything, they can just tune in to a single song and kind of leave with a better idea of my sense of humor,” she added.

Carpenter also said she wrote the song during a time period in which “I thought I was the s–t,” so “equating it to caffeine and that addiction was really fun and I definitely have a caffeine addiction as it is. So it really ends up being a full circle for me.”

“Espresso” is the singer’s first top 10 hit in the United States and the United Kingdom. She’s expected to release a new album this year with “Espresso” as the lead single.

In an interview with Maya Hawke for Interview Magazine, Carpenter said that she’s begun to approach music differently.

“I feel a lot freer and more excited about what I’m making now because I’ve realized that genre isn’t necessarily the most important thing,” she explained. “It’s about honesty and authenticity and whatever you gravitate towards. There were a lot of genres in my last album, and I like to think I’ll continue that throughout writing music.”

Late Night
Jake Gyllenhaal and Sabrina Carpenter's SNL Scooby-Doo Parody Has a Wild Ending
Mikey Day transformed into Shaggy while Sarah Sherman played Velma in a sketch that gets Sarah Squirm-style gory.

By Samantha Vincenty May 19, 2024, 1:08 PM ET

Scooby-Doo
Scooby-Doo and the gang did what they do best in a pretaped sketch for Jake Gyllenhaal's May 18 Saturday Night Live finale. But after they solved the mystery and the culprit's mask came off, their classic Scooby-Doo double-unmasking went horrifically awry — and things only got crazier from there.

How to Watch
Watch Saturday Night Live Saturdays at 11:30/10:30c on NBC and next day on Peacock.  

Gyllenhaal led the gang as Fred, while "Espresso" singer Sabrina Carpenter made for a great Daphne. It's unsurprising that Mikey Day and Sarah Sherman absolutely nailed their live-action Shaggy and Velma. Definitely more surprising is the Sarah Squirm-style turn the parody took in its final act, blood-spraying body horror and all.

Things got very weird in SNL's "Scooby-Doo" starring Sabrina Carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal
Aesthetically, the sketch looked exactly like a live-action version of the cartoon that's been running in various incarnations since the late 1960s. Opening on a shot of The Mystery Machine van parked outside a seemingly-haunted house, the action began with the gang prowling past a picture with cut-out eyes and capturing the spooky Shadow Phantom.

Ripping off a mask, they soon discovered it was actually Old Man Franklin (James Austin Johnson), a typical end to most Scooby-Doo mysteries. Shaggy uncovered a bookcase that opened a hidden passage, while Carpenter's Daphne lowered two pulleys that pulled a line of piano wire taught. (If you've seen any films in the Final Destination franchise, you probably sensed the foreshadowing in that shot).

"But who is Old Man Franklin — I mean, really?" Gyllenhaal's doofy Fred asked. "No one is who they appear to be." And that's often true in the real show — but when Fred went to tear off his presumed second mask, he wound up tearing his actual face off. 

"Quick, we need to put the face in a bowl of dry rice!" Daphne declared amid the gang's screams.  

"It's not a cellphone, you moron!" Velma told her.

Then Scooby (voiced by Andrew Dismukes) rendered the face irretrievable.

In the gang's subsequent panic, the swinging bookcase and piano wire became several members' undoing. The bloody finale took another turn when a police officer (Kenan Thompson) becomes an unwanted witness. But the biggest shock of all? The reveal of the product this all wound up being a commercial for.

"Scooby-Doo" is a fine companion to earlier pretaped sketches from Season 49 that have found Sarah Sherman wielding CGI and prosthetics to bend reality, such as "UNTOLD: Battle of the Sexes" featuring Jason Momoa and "The Anomalous Man" with Dua Lipa.

"Got my head chopped off twice in one season," Sherman proudly announced in a May 20 post on X (formerly Twitter), sharing clips of both scenes. "Bye bye Season 49."
