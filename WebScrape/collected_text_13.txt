"that's that me birthday," wrote Carpenter, a play on her original lyrics, "That's that me, espresso."

The post was accompanied by three photos of Carpenter as a baby, including a shot of the "Feather" singer in an Ohio State onesie, posing in a sparkling purple outfit and hat, and napping as a baby.

Carpenter also shared a photo to her Instagram Story of a birthday cake.

"Espresso" is currently No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 list.

Now we know what Sabrina Carpenter's shocked face looks like -- the singer was blown away by a surprise birthday party, and surrounded by her BF Barry Keoghan and a few dozen of her closest friends.

Sabrina screamed with joy as she walked into Dumbo House Saturday night in Brooklyn ... among the faces greeting her were rapper Ice Spice, who was shooting video as her pal tried to blow out all the candles on her 25th birthday cake.

The writing on her frosted cake said, "Is 25 that sweet? I guess so!" It's a reference to her song, "Espresso," which includes the line ... "Is it that sweet? I guess so!"


Barry planted a big fat kiss on Sabrina after she blew out the candles, and kept the party going with close to 100 people.



Even before the party, Sabrina had marked her birthday by posting childhood pics.

Her 25th trip around the Sun was an eventful one -- in the last 12 months, she's opened for Taylor Swift on the "Eras Tour," made her debut at Coachella ... and, of course, hooked up with Barry.

Sabrina Carpenter is celebrating a milestone birthday of titanic proportions.

The "Feather" singer turned 25 May 11 and marked the occasion at a party in New York City with friends and boyfriend Barry Keoghan, as seen in videos posted on TMZ and on social media. Rapper Ice Spice also shared on her Instagram Stories a clip of the birthday girl blowing out the candles on her sheet cake, which featured a Leonardo DiCaprio meme—a 2016 selfie of the Oscar winner bearing the caption, "Nooo don't turn 25 your so sexy aha."

The guest of honor also received a smaller, round cake containing the words, "Is 25 that sweet? I guess so!"—which includes lyrics from her latest single "Espresso."

The former Disney Channel star also quoted the song in her own birthday post shared on Instagram. "That's that me birthday," she wrote in the caption, alongside childhood photos of herself.

Barry, 31, commented with an emoji of a face holding back tears and an X.

Celebrities Attending Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour
Sabrina and the Saltburn actor confirmed their romance in February when they were photographed together in Los Angeles during a short break from Taylor Swift's Eras tour. The fellow singer had opened for her since summer 2023.

Later that month, Barry made their relationship Instagram official by commenting on a video Sabrina shared of herself performing with the Grammy winner onstage during her concert in Sydney, Australia. He would later go on to join her during the tour.

Then in March, the couple took their romance to Hollywood, attending Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party together. While they did not pose for joint photos upon their arrival, earlier this month, they made their romance red carpet official at the Met Gala.

If their relationship wasn't official enough already, Sabrina and Barry hard-launched through the singer's music video for "Please, Please, Please" in June 2024. Later, the Disney Channel alum detailed what the moment meant for her. 

"I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation," she gushed to Variety in August 2024. "So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”

Barry Keoghan Kisses Girlfriend Sabrina Carpenter on Her 25th Birthday
Us Weekly
Shelby Stivale
May 12, 2024 at 5:30 PM
Barry Keoghan seems to be living his best life with Sabrina Carpenter.

The Saltburn actor and “Nonsense” singer sparked romance rumors in December 2023 when the Daily Mail published photos of the duo on an outing in Los Angeles.

During her Disney Channel days, Carpenter was in a relationship with Bradley Steven Perry, which came to an end in 2015. She has also been romantically linked to Griffin Gluck, Joshua Bassett and Dylan O’Brien.

Keoghan, for his part, welcomed a son named Brando in August 2022 with ex-girlfriend Alyson Sandro. The couple were together for more than a year before they became parents. The Sun was first to report their split in July 2023. (Keoghan was also in a relationship with Shóna Guerin from 2017 to 2020.)

‘Saltburn’ Star Barry Keoghan’s Dating History

Despite his apparent romance with Carpenter, the Irish actor teamed up with Bumble for a jaw-dropping ad in February 2024, which featured Keoghan leaving little to the imagination as he posed in underwear.

Keep scrolling for a timeline of Keoghan and Carpenter’s romance so far:

December 2023
The Daily Mail first shared photos of Keoghan and Carpenter on an outing in Los Angeles. The singer was wearing a long leather coat while Keoghan walked behind her in a white shirt.

January 2024
Eagle-eyed fans spotted the pair together on a second Los Angeles outing. This time, they appeared to be enjoying a museum date night.

February 2024
Neither Keoghan nor Carpenter attended the Grammy Awards. However, they both attended the same W Magazine afterparty. The publication shared a photo of the duo alongside a caption that read, “Spotted in the crowd were Barry Keoghan (@Keoghan92) chatting with @SabrinaCarpenter,” in part.

In the photo, Keoghan held his hand over his mouth while Carpenter hid behind her drink.

Later that same month, the couple had their third Los Angeles date. This time, People Magazine obtained photos of Keoghan and Carpenter after a dinner date at Delilah in West Hollywood. The actor was all smiles while walking behind the singer, who looked cute in a little black dress for the night out.

Barry Keoghan and Sabrina Carpenter Timeline

Keoghan traveled to Singapore to watch Carpenter open for Taylor Swift. Concertgoers captured footage of the actor smiling as the singer improvised her notoriously NSFW outro to her song “Nonsense.” With Keoghan in the audience, she sang, “He said that he wishes he was on me / Got me wetter than the Jewel Changi / Singapore I hope you like my songy.”

An insider later told Us Weekly exclusively that Keoghan and Carpenter have been exclusively dating since at least January 2024.

“They really took things slow at first, but the relationship is going strong,” a source told Us. “They are both very casual people and enjoy being low-key in their downtime. They aren’t putting too much pressure on things, and Sabrina loves that Barry understands she is extremely busy with her work commitments right now.”

Of Keoghan attending Carpenter’s Eras performances, the insider noted that she finds it “really cute” that the actor is cheering her on.

Days after returning from Singapore, the pair attended the Vanity Fair Oscar party together, posing just a few feet apart on the red carpet. A source exclusively told Us that they were much cozier while inside the party, often holding hands.

“Sabrina and Barry were together almost the entire night,” the insider at the party shared. “They looked really cute and happy as they took selfies and were walking around the party together.”

Celebrity Couples Who Prove That Love Isn’t Dead

April 2024
Keoghan supported Carpenter during her 2024 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival performance. As Carpenter belted out her tunes, Keoghan was photographed filming the set on his phone.

The pair were also spotted in the crowd with Swift and her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, per fan footage posted via X.

Keoghan and Carpenter made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Met Gala. While they each walked the carpet solo, they reunited at the top of the stairs and posed for pics together.

Carpenter wore a stunning custom Oscar de la Renta gown, which left Keoghan in awe.

“Oh s–t,” the Irish actor quipped ahead of the awards show in Vogue’s getting ready video. “Am I not allowed to curse?”

Carpenter then proclaimed that she loved Keoghan’s velvet Burberry jacket and coordinating top hat before they shared a sweet peck.

Following the Met Gala, Carpenter celebrated her 25th birthday on May 11 with a surprise birthday party in New York City, attended by Keoghan. Per videos obtained by TMZ, Carpenter blew out her birthday candles before accepting a celebratory kiss from Keoghan.

Sabrina Carpenter with her cake and boyfriend Barry Keoghan
Sabrina Carpenter celebrated her 25th birthday with a star-studded bash — and a hilarious cake!

On Saturday, May 11, the "Espresso" singer's boyfriend, actor Barry Keoghan, threw her a party at DUMBO House in Brooklyn with about 100 friends — including rapper Ice Spice — a source told PEOPLE.

According to the source, the event space was decked out for the occasion with blue, yellow and white balloons. Guests dined on an array of food options, and enjoyed a custom drink menu — which of course featured espresso martinis, presumably in honor of Carpenter's new single "Espresso," which is currently charting at the No. 2 spot on the Billboard Global 200 chart.

Sabrina Carpenter with her birthday cake
Ice Spice, 24, shared a video on her Instagram Stories of the moment that Carpenter blew out the candles on her cake, which featured a meme photo of Leonardo DiCaprio.

In the cake photo, which was spotted by some eagle-eyed fans on X (formerly Twitter), one of the actor's selfies is edited to look like a Snapchat message, with a caption reading, "Nooo don't turn 25 [you're] so sexy aha." The meme is a play off of a recurring joke about the actor's love life — specifically, that he doesn't date women over the age of 25.

According to the source, Carpenter blew out her candles before sharing a sweet kiss with Keoghan, 31.

Also on Saturday, the Disney Channel alum shared a post on Instagram featuring some photos from throughout her childhood — and received some birthday wishes from some big stars, including Keoghan, who left a "🥹" emoji and an "x," symbolizing a kiss.

Carpenter also showed off another birthday cake on her Instagram Stories, sharing a photo of the white-frosted confection, which was topped with cookie dough, sprinkles and writing that said: "Is 25 that sweet? I guess so!"

The cake's message was a nod to "Espresso," which features the lyrics: "Is it that sweet? I guess so!"

Carpenter's sister Sarah left a comment that nodded to the song's lyrics, writing: "ur partying late cuz it’s ur BIRTHDAY." (The song's lyrics are, "I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer.")

The Little Mermaid star Chloe Bailey also sent Carpenter some well-wishes, writing simply, "Happy birthday love," along with a heart-eyed emoji.

Danielle Fishel, the Boy Meets World alum who starred alongside Carpenter in the reboot Girl Meets World, wished her former costar a happy birthday. "Happy birthday to my forever bb girl!! I love you more than you'll ever know. ❤️❤️ See you soooooon!!" Fishel wrote.

Saturday also served as Keoghan and Carpenter's first birthday celebration together since they went public with their relationship earlier this year. Just last week, the pair posed next to each other at the top of the Met Gala stairs before entering the high-fashion event, and last month, the Irish actor supported his girlfriend as she performed on the main stage at Coachella.

Sabrina Carpenter rings 25th birthday with nod to ‘Espresso’
Sabrina Carpenter adorned her birthday cake with Espresso lyrics
By Web DeskMay 12, 2024
Sabrina Carpenter shared adorable photos from her childhood in a birthday post
Sabrina Carpenter shared adorable photos from her childhood in a birthday post
Sabrina Carpenter tuned in to her 25th birthday, paying tribute to her latest single, Espresso.

Celebrating her birthday on Saturday, May 11, the Feather singer took to social media to share a carousel of her adorable photos accompanied by a caption.


"That’s that me birthday," the caption simply read, nodding to the lyrics of her latest chart-topping track.

The montage of three photos featured her childhood photographs. In one, a toddler-aged Carpenter wore a red Ohio State University shirt and can be seen throwing her hands up as she smiled at someone from behind the camera.


The following snapshot appeared from her initial days of acting career in which she was striking a sassy pose in a glittery purple dress with a wide grin on her face.

In the last image, baby Carpenter was captured nestled in a chair, face-palming while sucking on a pacifier and wearing a pink dress.

In addition to the carousel of endearing photos, the songstress also shared an Instagram story that gave a glimpse into her birthday cake.

The white frosted sponge topped with cookie dough and sprinkles was adorned with the text, "Is 25 that sweet? I guess so."

The cake’s message was a clever selection of words referring to one of the lyrics from Espresso, "Is it that sweet? I guess so!"

Additionally, the birthday girl received warm wishes from her friends and fans, making her special day even sweeter.
