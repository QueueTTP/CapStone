ESPRESSO
by SABRINA CARPENTER
Take a sip of Espresso, an exuberant and frothy nu-disco funk tune, from US singer, songwriter and actress Sabrina Carpenter, released 11 April 2024 via Island Records.

Written by Julian Bunetta (who also produced the track), Amy Allen, Sabrina Carpenter and Steph Jones, complete with a sunkissed music video directed by Dave Meyers,  the bright and breezy track is the perfect accompaniment to a hot summer's day. Perhaps no surprise then that Espresso quickly became Sabrina's first UK Top 10 single some three years after her first UK chart appearance with Skin in 2021. Espresso debuted straight in at Number 6, before rising to Number 5 the following week.

Two weeks after its chart debut on 3 May 2024 Espresso became Sabrina Carpenter's first UK Number 1 single.

Official Charts confirmed the niche-but-true fact that Espresso was officially the highest-charting song about caffeine in 24 years, since All Saints' 2000 hit Black Coffee.

Taylor Swift fans are sharing their hilarious reactions to the 'wild' Saturday Night Live lineup that sees the popstar's close pal Sabrina Carpenter performing as the All Too Well superstar's ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, hosts. 

On Thursday night, the comedy TV show announced that the Espresso songstress - who opened up for Taylor on the Latin America, Asia, and Australian legs of her Eras Tour - would be teaming up with her friend's past lover and 43-year-old actor Jake. 

The actor dated the Bad Blood singer in October 2010 into early 2011 and is believed to be the inspiration behind the hit song All Too Well. 







And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's shows, the blonde duo developed a close friendship and fans have now become 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's former flame.

Floods of reactions came onto Instagram and Twitter when SNL announced the update on their Instagram, which revealed that Sabrina would be the musical guest alongside host Jake on May 18. 

Fans immediately ran to the comments section to express their shock and 'excitement.'

One person said: 'This is so messy, I'm so excited.' 

Someone else added: 'Having Sabrina and Jake is literally the funniest thing I've ever seen.' 

'Pairing one of Taylor Swift's best friends with her ex is kind of wild,' another fan added.

'Awkward,' one person wrote. 

Others brought up the 'scarf' Taylor mentions in her song All Too Well, which reads, 'And, I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer, even now.' 

One fan quipped: 'Sabrina is taking back that scarf for real.' 

And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's show, the blonde duo (seen performing together at the Eras Tour) developed a close friendship and now fans are 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's ex

'Sabrina has the chance to do the funniest thing possible and cover All Too Well (please),' someone else said. 

One fan typed: 'SNL really paired Jake with Sabrina to stir the pot.' 

'SNL putting Sabrina carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal together is insane,' another mused. 

It is often theorized that the majority of Taylor's 2012 album Red is about Jake. 

In 2022, Jake revealed his reaction to the songstress creating hits about him. 

While speaking to Esquire, he admitted that he didn't pay any attention to the lyrics of her hits and even understood her need to create songs inspired by him. 

'Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that,' Jake said.

Taylor seems to have left Jake in the past though and has since been flaunting her PDA-riddled romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 

This isn't the first time that fans have called attention to the Nonsense hitmaker's friendship with Taylor.

Just last month, Swifties slammed Sabrina for her collaboration with SKIMS, a lingerie brand owned by Kim Kardashian. 

Taylor and Kim have been locked in a feud since 2016.

One commented on Kim's Instagram's post promoting the Sabrina shoot: 'The Swiftie crossover I never saw coming,' while another said, 'The swiftie universe has glitched.'

Another tweeted: 'How she gonna open for Taylor Swift then work for Kim Kardashian?'

But fans pointed out that 'everything is business' and Taylor's other close friends like Selena Gomez have worked with Skims in the past.

Taylor and Kim's feud began back in 2016 when Kim released a recorded phone call claiming that Taylor gave consent for her then-husband, Kanye West, to pen vulgar lyrics about her.

Since then both stars have made various jibes and references to the row, with Taylor particularly taking aim in her 2017 album Reputation.

The latest development came in December 2023 when Taylor claimed in an interview that her dispute with Kim 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding before branding her and her ex-husband Kanye 'trash.'

Many fans called Kim 'a marketing genius' for using Sabrina as the star of her latest campaign.

Taylor Swift fans are sharing their hilarious reactions to the 'wild' Saturday Night Live lineup that sees the popstar's close pal Sabrina Carpenter performing as the All Too Well superstar's ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, hosts. 

On Thursday night, the comedy TV show announced that the Espresso songstress - who opened up for Taylor on the Latin America, Asia, and Australian legs of her Eras Tour - would be teaming up with her friend's past lover and 43-year-old actor Jake. 

The actor dated the Bad Blood singer in October 2010 into early 2011 and is believed to be the inspiration behind the hit song All Too Well. 







And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's shows, the blonde duo developed a close friendship and fans have now become 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's former flame.

Floods of reactions came onto Instagram and Twitter when SNL announced the update on their Instagram, which revealed that Sabrina would be the musical guest alongside host Jake on May 18. 

Fans immediately ran to the comments section to express their shock and 'excitement.'

One person said: 'This is so messy, I'm so excited.' 

Someone else added: 'Having Sabrina and Jake is literally the funniest thing I've ever seen.' 

'Pairing one of Taylor Swift's best friends with her ex is kind of wild,' another fan added.

'Awkward,' one person wrote. 

Others brought up the 'scarf' Taylor mentions in her song All Too Well, which reads, 'And, I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer, even now.' 

One fan quipped: 'Sabrina is taking back that scarf for real.' 

And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's show, the blonde duo (seen performing together at the Eras Tour) developed a close friendship and now fans are 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's ex

'Sabrina has the chance to do the funniest thing possible and cover All Too Well (please),' someone else said. 

One fan typed: 'SNL really paired Jake with Sabrina to stir the pot.' 

'SNL putting Sabrina carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal together is insane,' another mused. 

It is often theorized that the majority of Taylor's 2012 album Red is about Jake. 

In 2022, Jake revealed his reaction to the songstress creating hits about him. 

While speaking to Esquire, he admitted that he didn't pay any attention to the lyrics of her hits and even understood her need to create songs inspired by him. 

'Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that,' Jake said.

Taylor seems to have left Jake in the past though and has since been flaunting her PDA-riddled romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 

This isn't the first time that fans have called attention to the Nonsense hitmaker's friendship with Taylor.

Just last month, Swifties slammed Sabrina for her collaboration with SKIMS, a lingerie brand owned by Kim Kardashian. 

Taylor and Kim have been locked in a feud since 2016.

One commented on Kim's Instagram's post promoting the Sabrina shoot: 'The Swiftie crossover I never saw coming,' while another said, 'The swiftie universe has glitched.'

Another tweeted: 'How she gonna open for Taylor Swift then work for Kim Kardashian?'

But fans pointed out that 'everything is business' and Taylor's other close friends like Selena Gomez have worked with Skims in the past.

Taylor and Kim's feud began back in 2016 when Kim released a recorded phone call claiming that Taylor gave consent for her then-husband, Kanye West, to pen vulgar lyrics about her.

Since then both stars have made various jibes and references to the row, with Taylor particularly taking aim in her 2017 album Reputation.

The latest development came in December 2023 when Taylor claimed in an interview that her dispute with Kim 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding before branding her and her ex-husband Kanye 'trash.'

Many fans called Kim 'a marketing genius' for using Sabrina as the star of her latest campaign.

Taylor Swift fans are sharing their hilarious reactions to the 'wild' Saturday Night Live lineup that sees the popstar's close pal Sabrina Carpenter performing as the All Too Well superstar's ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, hosts. 

On Thursday night, the comedy TV show announced that the Espresso songstress - who opened up for Taylor on the Latin America, Asia, and Australian legs of her Eras Tour - would be teaming up with her friend's past lover and 43-year-old actor Jake. 

The actor dated the Bad Blood singer in October 2010 into early 2011 and is believed to be the inspiration behind the hit song All Too Well. 







And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's shows, the blonde duo developed a close friendship and fans have now become 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's former flame.

Floods of reactions came onto Instagram and Twitter when SNL announced the update on their Instagram, which revealed that Sabrina would be the musical guest alongside host Jake on May 18. 

Fans immediately ran to the comments section to express their shock and 'excitement.'

One person said: 'This is so messy, I'm so excited.' 

Someone else added: 'Having Sabrina and Jake is literally the funniest thing I've ever seen.' 

'Pairing one of Taylor Swift's best friends with her ex is kind of wild,' another fan added.

'Awkward,' one person wrote. 

Others brought up the 'scarf' Taylor mentions in her song All Too Well, which reads, 'And, I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer, even now.' 

One fan quipped: 'Sabrina is taking back that scarf for real.' 

And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's show, the blonde duo (seen performing together at the Eras Tour) developed a close friendship and now fans are 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's ex

'Sabrina has the chance to do the funniest thing possible and cover All Too Well (please),' someone else said. 

One fan typed: 'SNL really paired Jake with Sabrina to stir the pot.' 

'SNL putting Sabrina carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal together is insane,' another mused. 

It is often theorized that the majority of Taylor's 2012 album Red is about Jake. 

In 2022, Jake revealed his reaction to the songstress creating hits about him. 

While speaking to Esquire, he admitted that he didn't pay any attention to the lyrics of her hits and even understood her need to create songs inspired by him. 

'Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that,' Jake said.

Taylor seems to have left Jake in the past though and has since been flaunting her PDA-riddled romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 

This isn't the first time that fans have called attention to the Nonsense hitmaker's friendship with Taylor.

Just last month, Swifties slammed Sabrina for her collaboration with SKIMS, a lingerie brand owned by Kim Kardashian. 

Taylor and Kim have been locked in a feud since 2016.

One commented on Kim's Instagram's post promoting the Sabrina shoot: 'The Swiftie crossover I never saw coming,' while another said, 'The swiftie universe has glitched.'

Another tweeted: 'How she gonna open for Taylor Swift then work for Kim Kardashian?'

But fans pointed out that 'everything is business' and Taylor's other close friends like Selena Gomez have worked with Skims in the past.

Taylor and Kim's feud began back in 2016 when Kim released a recorded phone call claiming that Taylor gave consent for her then-husband, Kanye West, to pen vulgar lyrics about her.

Since then both stars have made various jibes and references to the row, with Taylor particularly taking aim in her 2017 album Reputation.

The latest development came in December 2023 when Taylor claimed in an interview that her dispute with Kim 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding before branding her and her ex-husband Kanye 'trash.'

Many fans called Kim 'a marketing genius' for using Sabrina as the star of her latest campaign.

Taylor Swift fans are sharing their hilarious reactions to the 'wild' Saturday Night Live lineup that sees the popstar's close pal Sabrina Carpenter performing as the All Too Well superstar's ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, hosts. 

On Thursday night, the comedy TV show announced that the Espresso songstress - who opened up for Taylor on the Latin America, Asia, and Australian legs of her Eras Tour - would be teaming up with her friend's past lover and 43-year-old actor Jake. 

The actor dated the Bad Blood singer in October 2010 into early 2011 and is believed to be the inspiration behind the hit song All Too Well. 







And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's shows, the blonde duo developed a close friendship and fans have now become 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's former flame.

Floods of reactions came onto Instagram and Twitter when SNL announced the update on their Instagram, which revealed that Sabrina would be the musical guest alongside host Jake on May 18. 

Fans immediately ran to the comments section to express their shock and 'excitement.'

One person said: 'This is so messy, I'm so excited.' 

Someone else added: 'Having Sabrina and Jake is literally the funniest thing I've ever seen.' 

'Pairing one of Taylor Swift's best friends with her ex is kind of wild,' another fan added.

'Awkward,' one person wrote. 

Others brought up the 'scarf' Taylor mentions in her song All Too Well, which reads, 'And, I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer, even now.' 

One fan quipped: 'Sabrina is taking back that scarf for real.' 

And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's show, the blonde duo (seen performing together at the Eras Tour) developed a close friendship and now fans are 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's ex

'Sabrina has the chance to do the funniest thing possible and cover All Too Well (please),' someone else said. 

One fan typed: 'SNL really paired Jake with Sabrina to stir the pot.' 

'SNL putting Sabrina carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal together is insane,' another mused. 

It is often theorized that the majority of Taylor's 2012 album Red is about Jake. 

In 2022, Jake revealed his reaction to the songstress creating hits about him. 

While speaking to Esquire, he admitted that he didn't pay any attention to the lyrics of her hits and even understood her need to create songs inspired by him. 

'Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that,' Jake said.

Taylor seems to have left Jake in the past though and has since been flaunting her PDA-riddled romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 

This isn't the first time that fans have called attention to the Nonsense hitmaker's friendship with Taylor.

Just last month, Swifties slammed Sabrina for her collaboration with SKIMS, a lingerie brand owned by Kim Kardashian. 

Taylor and Kim have been locked in a feud since 2016.

One commented on Kim's Instagram's post promoting the Sabrina shoot: 'The Swiftie crossover I never saw coming,' while another said, 'The swiftie universe has glitched.'

Another tweeted: 'How she gonna open for Taylor Swift then work for Kim Kardashian?'

But fans pointed out that 'everything is business' and Taylor's other close friends like Selena Gomez have worked with Skims in the past.

Taylor and Kim's feud began back in 2016 when Kim released a recorded phone call claiming that Taylor gave consent for her then-husband, Kanye West, to pen vulgar lyrics about her.

Since then both stars have made various jibes and references to the row, with Taylor particularly taking aim in her 2017 album Reputation.

The latest development came in December 2023 when Taylor claimed in an interview that her dispute with Kim 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding before branding her and her ex-husband Kanye 'trash.'

Many fans called Kim 'a marketing genius' for using Sabrina as the star of her latest campaign.

Taylor Swift fans are sharing their hilarious reactions to the 'wild' Saturday Night Live lineup that sees the popstar's close pal Sabrina Carpenter performing as the All Too Well superstar's ex-boyfriend, Jake Gyllenhaal, hosts. 

On Thursday night, the comedy TV show announced that the Espresso songstress - who opened up for Taylor on the Latin America, Asia, and Australian legs of her Eras Tour - would be teaming up with her friend's past lover and 43-year-old actor Jake. 

The actor dated the Bad Blood singer in October 2010 into early 2011 and is believed to be the inspiration behind the hit song All Too Well. 







And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's shows, the blonde duo developed a close friendship and fans have now become 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's former flame.

Floods of reactions came onto Instagram and Twitter when SNL announced the update on their Instagram, which revealed that Sabrina would be the musical guest alongside host Jake on May 18. 

Fans immediately ran to the comments section to express their shock and 'excitement.'

One person said: 'This is so messy, I'm so excited.' 

Someone else added: 'Having Sabrina and Jake is literally the funniest thing I've ever seen.' 

'Pairing one of Taylor Swift's best friends with her ex is kind of wild,' another fan added.

'Awkward,' one person wrote. 

Others brought up the 'scarf' Taylor mentions in her song All Too Well, which reads, 'And, I left my scarf there at your sister's house, and you've still got it in your drawer, even now.' 

One fan quipped: 'Sabrina is taking back that scarf for real.' 

And after Sabrina, 24, performed at Taylor's show, the blonde duo (seen performing together at the Eras Tour) developed a close friendship and now fans are 'obsessed' with the 'messy' decision to have the Nonsense hitmaker on stage with her friend's ex

'Sabrina has the chance to do the funniest thing possible and cover All Too Well (please),' someone else said. 

One fan typed: 'SNL really paired Jake with Sabrina to stir the pot.' 

'SNL putting Sabrina carpenter and Jake Gyllenhaal together is insane,' another mused. 

It is often theorized that the majority of Taylor's 2012 album Red is about Jake. 

In 2022, Jake revealed his reaction to the songstress creating hits about him. 

While speaking to Esquire, he admitted that he didn't pay any attention to the lyrics of her hits and even understood her need to create songs inspired by him. 

'Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that,' Jake said.

Taylor seems to have left Jake in the past though and has since been flaunting her PDA-riddled romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. 

This isn't the first time that fans have called attention to the Nonsense hitmaker's friendship with Taylor.

Just last month, Swifties slammed Sabrina for her collaboration with SKIMS, a lingerie brand owned by Kim Kardashian. 

Taylor and Kim have been locked in a feud since 2016.

One commented on Kim's Instagram's post promoting the Sabrina shoot: 'The Swiftie crossover I never saw coming,' while another said, 'The swiftie universe has glitched.'

Another tweeted: 'How she gonna open for Taylor Swift then work for Kim Kardashian?'

But fans pointed out that 'everything is business' and Taylor's other close friends like Selena Gomez have worked with Skims in the past.

Taylor and Kim's feud began back in 2016 when Kim released a recorded phone call claiming that Taylor gave consent for her then-husband, Kanye West, to pen vulgar lyrics about her.

Since then both stars have made various jibes and references to the row, with Taylor particularly taking aim in her 2017 album Reputation.

The latest development came in December 2023 when Taylor claimed in an interview that her dispute with Kim 'took her down psychologically' and forced her into hiding before branding her and her ex-husband Kanye 'trash.'

Many fans called Kim 'a marketing genius' for using Sabrina as the star of her latest campaign.

Some people wouldn’t think twice about Sabrina Carpenter being paired with Jake Gyllenhaal on an episode of Saturday Night Live. Many Swifties, however, are not those people.

Sabrina Carpenter to Be Musical Guest on Jake Gyllenhaal-Hosted ‘SNL’ Season Finale
05/02/2024
Immediately after NBC’s sketch-comedy series announced Thursday (May 2) that its upcoming season 49 finale would feature the actor as the host alongside the “Espresso” singer as musical guest, fans couldn’t help but draw a pretty glaring connection between the two: Ms. Taylor Swift. That’s because the “Anti-Hero” singer famously dated Gyllenhaal in 2010 and went on to write a number of songs believed to be about the Brokeback Mountain star — most notably, the searing 10-minute ballad “All Too Well” — while Carpenter is a longtime fan of Swift’s.







The Girl Meets World alum also struck up a friendship with the 14-time Grammy winner following her tenure as an opener on the Eras Tour. At one show, she and Swift duetted on “White Horse” and “Coney Island” during the main show, and after Carpenter wrapped her last performance on the trek, she wrote on Instagram, “i will cherish this taybrina era (and all the eras) till the end of time.”

With all that in mind, jokes about Gyllenhaal and Carpenter’s crossover have been aplenty since SNL unveiled its season-ending lineup. Some fans have been coming up with ways the Work It star could purposefully work a Swift reference into one of her famous “Nonsense” outros if she performs the Emails I Can’t Send fan-favorite on the show, while other people have daydreamed about ways Carpenter could hilariously confront Gyllenhaal during the episode, which airs May 18.

“would actually pay millions to see the text chain between taylor swift and sabrina carpenter about this one,” one fan tweeted, while another person added, “snl knew what they were doing pairing jake gyllenhaal and sabrina carpenter together.. they messy as hell for that.”

“sipping me espresso like you’re on a late night show,” a third Swiftie quipped, combining lyrics from Carpenter and Swift’s tracks.

Sabrina Carpenter is in the midst of a major battle, and her fiercest competitor is none other than herself.

As the U.K.’s Official Singles Chart reaches its midweek point, Carpenter’s smash hit “Espresso” remains piping hot and is neck-and-neck with “Please Please Please” (both via Island Records) as both singles vie for the coveted No. 1 spot.

“Espresso” debuted straight in at No. 6 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart upon its release, and on May 3, 2024, it became Carpenter’s very first U.K. leader. It also marked the highest-charting U.K. No. 1 about caffeine in 24 years, since All Saints’ 2000 hit “Black Coffee.”

Meanwhile “Please Please Please,” the second single from Carpenter’s sixth studio album Short ‘n’ Sweet, toppled Eminem‘s “Houdini” back in late June to secure Sabrina her second U.K. No. 1 single in less than two months, while “Espresso” stayed at No. 2. In doing so, Sabrina set a new Official Chart record, becoming the youngest female artist in history to hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Official Singles Chart in the same week.

In other U.K. singles chart news, rising star Chappell Roan is also making waves. Her catchy and heartfelt single “Good Luck, Babe!” (via Island) is poised to hit a new peak at No. 4, up from its debut in the top 10 last week.

Based on midweek sales and streaming data published by the Official Charts Company, Taylor Swift’s “Cruel Summer” (via EMI) is expected to re-enter the top 10 at No. 10, riding the wave of excitement from her The Eras Tour. Swift’s ability to keep her music relevant and engaging is once again on full display, as fans continue to support her timeless hits.

Dua Lipa, fresh off her headline performance at Glastonbury Festival, is seeing her track “Illusion” (via Warner Records) re-enter the top 20, currently at No. 13. The festival’s influence is also boosting Coldplay, with their new song “feelslikeimfallinginlove” (via Atlantic) set to reach a new peak at No. 21. Both acts have clearly benefited from their standout performances, drawing renewed attention to their latest releases.

BTS icon Jimin is aiming for his third top 40 U.K. single with “Smeraldo Garden Marching Band” (via Big Hit Music) featuring rapper Loco, with the track projected to land at No. 18. Inspired by The Beatles‘ iconic Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the K-Pop star’s latest solo effort sees him once again collaborate with renowned producers Pdogg, GHSTLOOP, and EVAN, who previously worked on his debut solo album, FACE.

Stay tuned for the final chart results at the end of the week to see which tracks secure their positions.

Someone Needs To Check On Joshua Bassett Because WTF Is This Olivia Post?
By Ilana Frost | May 03, 2024
Comments
There’s only one word for this behavior: tomfoolery. Like most other people who stumbled upon Joshua Bassett’s latest TikTok, I thought the post was a fan edit. But the High School Musical The Musical: The Series star indeed shared a photo of himself looking into Olivia Rodrigo’s eyes and smiling. And what’s playing in the background? His new song referencing a relationship from four years ago, of course. I can’t do this anymore. I’m tired. (If you missed it, Olivia and Josh dated in 2020, he moved on to Sabrina Carpenter, and it was a whole thing.) Olivia’s Grammy-winnng debut album, SOUR, covered this topic thoroughly, and then we got plenty of Josh and Sabrina response songs. *Like Sabrina, I choose to pretend “Skin” never happened.

I really do feel for Josh. He’s undeniably the muse of our generation, considering Olivia’s now an A-list pop star, selling out four nights at Madison Square Garden, and Sabrina currently has the No. 1 pop song (“Espresso”). Unfortunately, the guy just doesn’t have star power like his exes. After he released a very low-key EP sharing his perspective on the Olivia/Sabrina matter, Josh entered his questionable Christian era. Then he disappeared for a bit. And now, he’s back with this insane Olivia song and post. So, what the fuck is going on? Are Josh and Olivia pals again?

Clearly, there aren’t super hard feelings on Josh’s end if he’s posting an old photo with Olivia from their Disney days. Plus, in “The Golden Years,” the song he’s promoting, Josh sings about missing a romance from four years ago (*cough* the Olivia relationship), so he obviously has fond memories of that time. Josh and Olivia did pose for playful red carpet pics together in July 2022 at the HSMTMTS season 3 premiere — post-“driver’s license” drama. That being said, he still doesn’t follow Olivia on Instagram. (And Olivia doesn’t follow anyone on Instagram.)

A recent Olivia release might provide more hints. “You know I’ll always think of you, I’ll love you ’til the end of time / You are the best thing that I’ll ever keep so far out of my life,” she sings in “stranger.” So… no hard feelings on her end either? I’d say these two are not besties, but they don’t hate each other anymore.

Who Is Olivia Rodrigo Dating?

ADVERTISEMENT
The “driver’s license” queen is extremely in love with her British actor BF, Louis Partridge. They’ve been linked since October 2023, and he’s basically been on tour with Olivia, filming her and cheering her on at several of the GUTS shows. Louis even inspired a new Olivia song, “so american.” She croons in the chorus: “I’d go anywhere he goes / And he says I’m so American / Oh, God, I’m gonna marry him / If he keeps this shit up / I might just be in lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love.” So yeah, it’s going well.

Who Is Joshua Bassett Dating?
It seems like our guy is single and, like, not ready to mingle at the moment, but ya never know… he could be seeing someone and keeping things out of the public eye. If I were him, I’d definitely never wanna have another public relationship.

Someone Needs To Check On Joshua Bassett Because WTF Is This Olivia Post?
By Ilana Frost | May 03, 2024
Comments
There’s only one word for this behavior: tomfoolery. Like most other people who stumbled upon Joshua Bassett’s latest TikTok, I thought the post was a fan edit. But the High School Musical The Musical: The Series star indeed shared a photo of himself looking into Olivia Rodrigo’s eyes and smiling. And what’s playing in the background? His new song referencing a relationship from four years ago, of course. I can’t do this anymore. I’m tired. (If you missed it, Olivia and Josh dated in 2020, he moved on to Sabrina Carpenter, and it was a whole thing.) Olivia’s Grammy-winnng debut album, SOUR, covered this topic thoroughly, and then we got plenty of Josh and Sabrina response songs. *Like Sabrina, I choose to pretend “Skin” never happened.

Hannah Einbinder Knows Everything Is Because of 'Hacks'
By H. Alan Scott

There's one show on TV everybody is talking about: Hacks. After a two-year hiatus, season 3 of Hacks premiered on Max this week and well, it's everything.

If you're unfamiliar with the show, it stars Jean Smart as Deborah Vance, a Joan Rivers-like Vegas comic navigating her sudden resurgence in fame alongside her comedy writer Ava, played by Hannah Einbinder. What makes this show so good are the performances and chemistry of the two leads, Smart and Einbinder, and that dance they do between comedy and drama. It's one of the most well-written shows on TV right now.

I've been an early fan of the show—I mean, my Instagram account has basically become a Hacks fan account. Last year, I spoke with Smart about her Emmy-winning turn as Vance, and now I'm speaking with Einbinder about her own performance and what it's like to stand in the presence of Jean Smart.

Speaking of Smart, can we talk about how great she is for a moment? One of my favorite moments in television history is this one moment from the sitcom that made Smart famous, Designing Women. Basically, she's met in a dream by her guardian movie star, Dolly Parton. I spoke with Smart and Parton about this moment, and the fact that they also remember this moment fondly, well little kid me is screaming right now that I was able to even talk to them about it. But Smart went on from there to show she's more than just a comedic actress, winning and being nominated for countless Emmys for her work on projects like 24, Fargo, Mare of Easttown and Watchmen. Do yourself a favor and have a Jean Smart watch party this weekend.

Listen to my chat with Einbinder about this new season of Hacks on the latest Parting Shot podcast. And scroll down for more entertainment news. I'll be back Monday with my hot takes. (And getting prepped for Monday night's Met Gala.)

'Tattooist of Auschwitz' Actress Melanie Lynskey Reveals Filming Challenge
By Sophie Lloyd

Melanie Lynskey has revealed her biggest "challenge" while filming Peacock's new historical drama The Tattooist of Auschwitz.

The Critics' Choice Award winner is known for playing complex female characters, such as Shauna in psychological horror Yellowjackets, or revolutionary leader Kathleen in zombie drama The Last of Us.

However, Lynskey has taken on a tamer, but no less stimulating role in The Tattooist of Auschwitz. The 46 year old stars as Heather Morris, the author behind the book the six-episode series is based on.

Taylor Swift fans found it funny that one of her exes will be on the same 'SNL' episode as her friend Sabrina Carpenter.

While some fans thought it was in bad taste for the Disney Channel alum, 24, to be on the same episode as Gyllenhaal, most found it to be a hilarious coincidence.

"If there is not a sketch on 'All Too Well,' it’s gonna be a riot," one person wrote on social media, referring to the tune Swift, 34, is rumored to have wrote about her breakup from the actor, 43.

"Wow. SNL chose violence on May 18," another Instagram used quipped, while a third said, "this is so messy, I'm so excited."

Others joked that Carpenter could ask the movie star to give back Swift's red scarf, a reference to the viral lyric from "All Too Well," in which the Grammy winner claimed she left the accessory at his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal's house after their 2010 split.

Carpenter was one of Swift's opening acts on the Eras Tour.

The "Love Story" crooner's romance with the actor lasted for just a few months but is believed to have influenced several tracks on Swift's album Red. When she released the rerecorded version of the disc, she included the original 10-minute version of the song, which she played on SNL in 2021.

Though the superstar never confirms who her songs are about, she gave some insight into the "All Too Well" songwriting process in an interview with Rolling Stone.

"It was a day when I was just, like, a broken human, walking into rehearsal just feeling terrible about what was going on in my personal life," she recalled. "I just ended up playing four chords over and over again, and the band started kicking in."

"[They] just started singing and riffing and ad-libbing this song," Swift explained. "People just started playing along with me ... I think they could tell I was really going through it."

The actor has been dating model Jeanne Cadieu since 2018.

In a 2022 Esquire article, the Brokeback Mountain lead star was asked about the updated version of the song.

"It has nothing to do with me. It's about her relationship with her fans," he shared of her telling more on their romance. "It is her expression. Artists tap into personal experiences for inspiration, and I don't begrudge anyone that."

However, he also touched on Swifties harassing him via social media, questioning whether artists should take responsibility for "what we put into the world."

"At some point, I think it's important when supporters get unruly that we feel a responsibility to have them be civil and not allow for cyberbullying in one's name," he said.

Kate Beckinsale recently attended her first public event since being hospitalized for a "mysterious illness" in March.

According to Page Six, the beloved British actress stepped out at the King’s Trust 2024 Global Gala in New York City on Thursday night (May 2) following a weeks-long hospital stay for a medical issue that was not disclosed to the public.

The 50-year-old standout donned a white tule gown for the event, featuring tall pumps and an updo complete with her signature black bow. Page Six mentioned that Beckinsale posted multiple photos throughout the entirety of her hospital stay in March, a few featuring a similar-looking bow to the one she wore to the gala.

On March 11th, she shared a handful of snaps to her story honoring her mother, Judy Loe, for U.K. Mother’s Day (March 10), with a "cryptic" message that read:

"Thank you to those that love us and support us when it’s s–t and try to make sure there are some bits that aren’t. And for looking after our dogs when we can’t, and lead us to remember happy things when we can’t. And turn up when we are sick and sit with us … And send balloons and check in and pull us out of wells with love.”
All the photos taken during the actresses hospital stay have since been deleted from her Instagram page. Despite multiple celebrity friends and concerned followers commenting on her posts asking what was wrong with her, Beckinsale never revealed a diagnosis. In spite of recent mystery surrounding her condition, the icon did post a photo on April 11th wearing a shirt that said “Tummy Troubles Survivor,” leading fans to believe that she was hospitalized for stomach issues.
