Is ‘SNL’ new tonight? Host, musical guest details

Is 'SNL' New Tonight 2022Will Heath/NBC

Is “SNL” new tonight? NO. NBC‘s sketch comedy series aired its Season 49 finale on Saturday, May 18, 2024, with host Jake Gyllenhaal and musical guest Sabrina Carpenter. Looking ahead, the long-running program will air reruns throughout the summer until Season 50 debuts later this fall on NBC.

The regular cast members for “Saturday Night Live” Season 49 were, in credits order: Michael Che, Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, James Austin Johnson, Punkie Johnson, Colin Jost, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman, Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang. The featured players were: Marcello Hernandez, Molly Kearney, Michael Longfellow, Chloe Troast and Devon Walker.


SEE‘SNL’: Longest-running cast members ever on ‘Saturday Night Live’
The Writers Guild of America 2023 strike lasted from May 2 to September 27, while the SAG-AFTRA 2023 strike went from July 14 to November 9. Since “SNL” does not fall under the purview of the Screen Actors Guild, that is why the show’s actors were allowed to work during October of 2023 while picketing was still going on in other parts of the industry.

“Saturday Night Live’s” Weekend Update was once again anchored by Colin Jost and Michael Che in Season 49, just as they had done every week together since September of 2014. As of “SNL’s” 47th season two years ago, Jost and Che are officially the longest-serving duo in the history of Weekend Update.

SEE‘Saturday Night Live’ Season 49 cast for ‘SNL’ 2023-24

It’s another fellow canuck…LORNE MICHAELS, Carolyn dear. Tom Green & Lorne Green are also Canucks like me…the former a comedian/actor (once actually married to Drew Barrymore) & the latter the patriarch of Bonanza fame. I bet u r a fan of OUR Gordie Lightfoot & Jonie Mitchell too ? 😉. (Their music is timeless & is often played in AB on CKUA radio… our ‘treasure station’ heard globally now on internet). Canadians have really come into their own since the 1950s. Exporting their very best to the USA & the world in music & all manner of the entertainment industry. We are all very proud of “our own” & their many successes. Happy for them representing us well as a country. Not ‘patriotic’ like our neighbors to the south… just kindly Canucks well loved globally. Heck, even Americans wear 🇨🇦 when they travel I’ve found in my travels to Europe. #SNLforever 😉

I respect Rush as a power trio, love tgeir instrumental stuff but I cannot stand Alex Leifson’s singing. Like fingernails on a chalkboard covered with worms (I also hate worms) Alex Leifsons talking voice is quite nice, and he seems like a very funny and personable guy. Just can’t stand to hear him sing. Given, they’re hugely popular and incredibly accomplished so no I’ll will here. I simply prefer The Rolling Stones or The Beatles.

I did not realize until now that, not counting Che and Jost, there are 8 regular cast members and 6 featured cast members. I’ve noticed that it feels that the show is giving a lot of time to the newer cast, and that makes sense given the relative numbers.

(Not saying it’s good or bad that the show is more skewed towards the newcomers than in many years, maybe ever. Just that it’s different from before.)

Been watching and loving SNL since 1975 and this is the first season I don’t care if I miss an episode. When I do watch it, find myself playing Wordle through most of it. If i it wasn’t for Che and Jost don’t think I’d get any laughs.

So true, I’ve been watching since the beginning, IMO it hasn’t been funny in a long time, Kristen Wig, Kenan Thompson, Kate McKinnon, can’t remember their names but the girl that played “Kathy Ann” on weekend update sometimes, and Lesley?? The black girl are the only ones that were saving it the last 8-9 years, I watch 5 mins then try to find something else that’s comedy, can’t afford cable or streaming so it’s the Antenna hanging on the window, seems whoever does programming for the networks think all of us Boomers prefer crime shows or infomercials, it really SUCKS! especially living alone on very low fixed income, no way to have a social life

Fans of “SNL” may be disappointed that the show is on a brief hiatus, but the lineup of upcoming hosts and musical guests looks promising. With such a talented regular cast and an impressive roster of guest stars, it’s sure to be a great end to Season 48.

They should also make something about Red dead 2

The really funny ones for me:
-Three sad virgins
-Rap roundtable
-Dear Santa
-most skits by the do not destroy trio
-marcello hernandez talking with colin jost about baseball. also the one about short kings
-marcello Antony coming home from college with a white gf. two skits, one with Bad Bunny

A few of the cast are not at all funny and I every time I try to give them another chance I get disappointed.

Sean Gillis was an absolute disgrace with his opening monologue. Beyond distasteful. I’ve been a super fan for 49 years, never failed. But this was for me the most disgusting tasteful monologue ever. Lorne, What were you thinking? Desperate?

Was quite looking forward to advertised Sydney/Kacie episode -saw a couple of adverts for it, with Heidi…
after what I thought lamest episode in a LONG while last week w/ Sean and likewise musical ‘talent’
So horrified when they re-ran it tonite-WTF?!
whatever happened with Sydney they couldn’t rerun another worthwhile recent episode like Kate McKinnon…??!?

Seems like a simple question (“Is SNL tonight new or a rerun?”) but you don’t get a straight answer from either the NBC schedule or the SNL official website itself. Ridiculous.

Is ‘SNL’ new tonight? Host, musical guest details

Is 'SNL' New Tonight 2022Will Heath/NBC

Is “SNL” new tonight? NO. NBC‘s sketch comedy series aired its Season 49 finale on Saturday, May 18, 2024, with host Jake Gyllenhaal and musical guest Sabrina Carpenter. Looking ahead, the long-running program will air reruns throughout the summer until Season 50 debuts later this fall on NBC.

The regular cast members for “Saturday Night Live” Season 49 were, in credits order: Michael Che, Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, James Austin Johnson, Punkie Johnson, Colin Jost, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman, Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang. The featured players were: Marcello Hernandez, Molly Kearney, Michael Longfellow, Chloe Troast and Devon Walker.


SEE‘SNL’: Longest-running cast members ever on ‘Saturday Night Live’
The Writers Guild of America 2023 strike lasted from May 2 to September 27, while the SAG-AFTRA 2023 strike went from July 14 to November 9. Since “SNL” does not fall under the purview of the Screen Actors Guild, that is why the show’s actors were allowed to work during October of 2023 while picketing was still going on in other parts of the industry.

“Saturday Night Live’s” Weekend Update was once again anchored by Colin Jost and Michael Che in Season 49, just as they had done every week together since September of 2014. As of “SNL’s” 47th season two years ago, Jost and Che are officially the longest-serving duo in the history of Weekend Update.

SEE‘Saturday Night Live’ Season 49 cast for ‘SNL’ 2023-24

It’s another fellow canuck…LORNE MICHAELS, Carolyn dear. Tom Green & Lorne Green are also Canucks like me…the former a comedian/actor (once actually married to Drew Barrymore) & the latter the patriarch of Bonanza fame. I bet u r a fan of OUR Gordie Lightfoot & Jonie Mitchell too ? 😉. (Their music is timeless & is often played in AB on CKUA radio… our ‘treasure station’ heard globally now on internet). Canadians have really come into their own since the 1950s. Exporting their very best to the USA & the world in music & all manner of the entertainment industry. We are all very proud of “our own” & their many successes. Happy for them representing us well as a country. Not ‘patriotic’ like our neighbors to the south… just kindly Canucks well loved globally. Heck, even Americans wear 🇨🇦 when they travel I’ve found in my travels to Europe. #SNLforever 😉

I respect Rush as a power trio, love tgeir instrumental stuff but I cannot stand Alex Leifson’s singing. Like fingernails on a chalkboard covered with worms (I also hate worms) Alex Leifsons talking voice is quite nice, and he seems like a very funny and personable guy. Just can’t stand to hear him sing. Given, they’re hugely popular and incredibly accomplished so no I’ll will here. I simply prefer The Rolling Stones or The Beatles.

This U.S. tax payer has the utmost respect and appreciation for the entertainment our northern neighbors have always blessed us with!
Without Canadians, American music and comedy would not be what it is.

I did not realize until now that, not counting Che and Jost, there are 8 regular cast members and 6 featured cast members. I’ve noticed that it feels that the show is giving a lot of time to the newer cast, and that makes sense given the relative numbers.

(Not saying it’s good or bad that the show is more skewed towards the newcomers than in many years, maybe ever. Just that it’s different from before.)

Been watching and loving SNL since 1975 and this is the first season I don’t care if I miss an episode. When I do watch it, find myself playing Wordle through most of it. If i it wasn’t for Che and Jost don’t think I’d get any laughs.

So true, I’ve been watching since the beginning, IMO it hasn’t been funny in a long time, Kristen Wig, Kenan Thompson, Kate McKinnon, can’t remember their names but the girl that played “Kathy Ann” on weekend update sometimes, and Lesley?? The black girl are the only ones that were saving it the last 8-9 years, I watch 5 mins then try to find something else that’s comedy, can’t afford cable or streaming so it’s the Antenna hanging on the window, seems whoever does programming for the networks think all of us Boomers prefer crime shows or infomercials, it really SUCKS! especially living alone on very low fixed income, no way to have a social life

On October 11, 1975 SNL broadcast it’s first show. In October of 1976 people started saying it wasn’t as good as it used to be.

Fans of “SNL” may be disappointed that the show is on a brief hiatus, but the lineup of upcoming hosts and musical guests looks promising. With such a talented regular cast and an impressive roster of guest stars, it’s sure to be a great end to Season 48.

They should also make something about Red dead 2

The really funny ones for me:
-Three sad virgins
-Rap roundtable
-Dear Santa
-most skits by the do not destroy trio
-marcello hernandez talking with colin jost about baseball. also the one about short kings
-marcello Antony coming home from college with a white gf. two skits, one with Bad Bunny

A few of the cast are not at all funny and I every time I try to give them another chance I get disappointed.

Sean Gillis was an absolute disgrace with his opening monologue. Beyond distasteful. I’ve been a super fan for 49 years, never failed. But this was for me the most disgusting tasteful monologue ever. Lorne, What were you thinking? Desperate?

Was quite looking forward to advertised Sydney/Kacie episode -saw a couple of adverts for it, with Heidi…
after what I thought lamest episode in a LONG while last week w/ Sean and likewise musical ‘talent’
So horrified when they re-ran it tonite-WTF?!
whatever happened with Sydney they couldn’t rerun another worthwhile recent episode like Kate McKinnon…??!?

Seems like a simple question (“Is SNL tonight new or a rerun?”) but you don’t get a straight answer from either the NBC schedule or the SNL official website itself. Ridiculous.

Is ‘SNL’ new tonight? Host, musical guest details

Is 'SNL' New Tonight 2022Will Heath/NBC

Is “SNL” new tonight? NO. NBC‘s sketch comedy series aired its Season 49 finale on Saturday, May 18, 2024, with host Jake Gyllenhaal and musical guest Sabrina Carpenter. Looking ahead, the long-running program will air reruns throughout the summer until Season 50 debuts later this fall on NBC.

The regular cast members for “Saturday Night Live” Season 49 were, in credits order: Michael Che, Mikey Day, Andrew Dismukes, Chloe Fineman, Heidi Gardner, James Austin Johnson, Punkie Johnson, Colin Jost, Ego Nwodim, Sarah Sherman, Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang. The featured players were: Marcello Hernandez, Molly Kearney, Michael Longfellow, Chloe Troast and Devon Walker.


SEE‘SNL’: Longest-running cast members ever on ‘Saturday Night Live’
The Writers Guild of America 2023 strike lasted from May 2 to September 27, while the SAG-AFTRA 2023 strike went from July 14 to November 9. Since “SNL” does not fall under the purview of the Screen Actors Guild, that is why the show’s actors were allowed to work during October of 2023 while picketing was still going on in other parts of the industry.

“Saturday Night Live’s” Weekend Update was once again anchored by Colin Jost and Michael Che in Season 49, just as they had done every week together since September of 2014. As of “SNL’s” 47th season two years ago, Jost and Che are officially the longest-serving duo in the history of Weekend Update.

SEE‘Saturday Night Live’ Season 49 cast for ‘SNL’ 2023-24

It’s another fellow canuck…LORNE MICHAELS, Carolyn dear. Tom Green & Lorne Green are also Canucks like me…the former a comedian/actor (once actually married to Drew Barrymore) & the latter the patriarch of Bonanza fame. I bet u r a fan of OUR Gordie Lightfoot & Jonie Mitchell too ? 😉. (Their music is timeless & is often played in AB on CKUA radio… our ‘treasure station’ heard globally now on internet). Canadians have really come into their own since the 1950s. Exporting their very best to the USA & the world in music & all manner of the entertainment industry. We are all very proud of “our own” & their many successes. Happy for them representing us well as a country. Not ‘patriotic’ like our neighbors to the south… just kindly Canucks well loved globally. Heck, even Americans wear 🇨🇦 when they travel I’ve found in my travels to Europe. #SNLforever 😉

I respect Rush as a power trio, love tgeir instrumental stuff but I cannot stand Alex Leifson’s singing. Like fingernails on a chalkboard covered with worms (I also hate worms) Alex Leifsons talking voice is quite nice, and he seems like a very funny and personable guy. Just can’t stand to hear him sing. Given, they’re hugely popular and incredibly accomplished so no I’ll will here. I simply prefer The Rolling Stones or The Beatles.

Without Canadians, American music and comedy would not be what it is.

I did not realize until now that, not counting Che and Jost, there are 8 regular cast members and 6 featured cast members. I’ve noticed that it feels that the show is giving a lot of time to the newer cast, and that makes sense given the relative numbers.

(Not saying it’s good or bad that the show is more skewed towards the newcomers than in many years, maybe ever. Just that it’s different from before.)

Been watching and loving SNL since 1975 and this is the first season I don’t care if I miss an episode. When I do watch it, find myself playing Wordle through most of it. If i it wasn’t for Che and Jost don’t think I’d get any laughs.

So true, I’ve been watching since the beginning, IMO it hasn’t been funny in a long time, Kristen Wig, Kenan Thompson, Kate McKinnon, can’t remember their names but the girl that played “Kathy Ann” on weekend update sometimes, and Lesley?? The black girl are the only ones that were saving it the last 8-9 years, I watch 5 mins then try to find something else that’s comedy, can’t afford cable or streaming so it’s the Antenna hanging on the window, seems whoever does programming for the networks think all of us Boomers prefer crime shows or infomercials, it really SUCKS! especially living alone on very low fixed income, no way to have a social life

On October 11, 1975 SNL broadcast it’s first show. In October of 1976 people started saying it wasn’t as good as it used to be.

Fans of “SNL” may be disappointed that the show is on a brief hiatus, but the lineup of upcoming hosts and musical guests looks promising. With such a talented regular cast and an impressive roster of guest stars, it’s sure to be a great end to Season 48.

They should also make something about Red dead 2

The really funny ones for me:
-Three sad virgins
-Rap roundtable
-Dear Santa
-most skits by the do not destroy trio
-marcello hernandez talking with colin jost about baseball. also the one about short kings
-marcello Antony coming home from college with a white gf. two skits, one with Bad Bunny

A few of the cast are not at all funny and I every time I try to give them another chance I get disappointed.

Sean Gillis was an absolute disgrace with his opening monologue. Beyond distasteful. I’ve been a super fan for 49 years, never failed. But this was for me the most disgusting tasteful monologue ever. Lorne, What were you thinking? Desperate?

Was quite looking forward to advertised Sydney/Kacie episode -saw a couple of adverts for it, with Heidi…
after what I thought lamest episode in a LONG while last week w/ Sean and likewise musical ‘talent’
So horrified when they re-ran it tonite-WTF?!
whatever happened with Sydney they couldn’t rerun another worthwhile recent episode like Kate McKinnon…??!?

Seems like a simple question (“Is SNL tonight new or a rerun?”) but you don’t get a straight answer from either the NBC schedule or the SNL official website itself. Ridiculous.
