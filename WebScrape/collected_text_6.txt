In the spotlight since her acting debut on Disney Channel’s “Girl Meets World” in 2014, Sabrina Carpenter has been making headlines and topping charts with her hit songs “Espresso” and “Please, Please, Please” in 2024.

Carpenter often embraces ultra-feminine looks on stage, favoring sparkly minidresses and corset styles, adding 60s-inspired accessories and platform heels. On red carpets, she has worn Alberta Ferretti, Paco Rabanne, Vera Wang, Louis Vuitton and other luxury brands.

Here, WWD takes a closer look at Carpenter’s style evolution ahead of her “Short n’ Sweet” tour, which starts in September. See the photos below.

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 17: In this photo illustration, a box of the diabetes drug Ozempic rests on a pharmacy counter on April 17, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Ozempic was originally approved by the FDA to treat people with Type 2 diabetes- who risk serious health consequences without medication. In recent months, there has been a spike in demand for Ozempic, or semaglutide, due to its weight loss benefits, which has led to shortages. Some doctors prescribe Ozempic off-label to treat obesity.

The Sabrina Carpenter and Camila Cabello feud seems to be erupting in song lyrics.

Sabrina’s new album, Short ‘n’ Sweet, is taking fans by storm. In addition to the title being a clear reference to her diminutive height, fans are already commenting on songs with similar vibes to her bestie Taylor Swift’s songs, especially “False God.”

But “Dumb and Poetic” and “Coincidence” seem to be very personal for Sabrina.

It looks like she’s taking a swipe at ex Shawn Mendes and at his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Camila Cabello.

Met Gala 2024: Photos From the Red Carpet
05/06/2024
In an adorable moment from Vogue‘s newly shared video of the “Feather” singer getting ready for the red carpet Monday (May 5), the Saltburn star crashed the party to get a first-look at his famous girlfriend’s glamorous gown. As he walked in, already dressed up in his brown suit jacket and top hat, Carpenter’s face lit up as she cooed, “Baby!”

“Oh, s–t,” he said with awe upon seeing the Work It actress’ Brigitte Bardot-inspired look.

He then gave Carpenter a big kiss on the cheek as she wrapped her arms around his neck. When it came time to head over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where the annual fashion extravaganza is held on the first Monday in May each year, they both adorably wished Vogue viewers a good evening.

Shortly afterward, the stars — who’ve been dating since the beginning of the year — posed separately on the red carpet, Carpenter modeling a custom black-and-baby-blue Oscar De La Renta gown. To the side of the carpet, they snapped a quick photo together.

This year, the event was co-chaired by Zendaya, Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth and featured a guest list that included Ariana Grande, Lana Del Rey, Camila Cabello, Lizzo and dozens more stars. Also in attendance was Demi Lovato, whose silver Prabal Gurung-designed gown was a personal favorite of Carpenter’s.

“stunnnnningggg,” the “Espresso” artist commented on Lovato’s TikTok showing off the dress.

Sabrina Carpenter Opens Up About Navigating A New Love In The Public Eye
As well as the support she's received from Taylor Swift throughout it all

Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan may have been the celebrity couple that no one saw coming, but their loved-up displays have quickly evolved from blurry paparazzi snaps to Keoghan starring in the singer’s ‘Please, Please, Please’ music video as her nefarious lover.

While many Hollywood romances typically fly well under the radar before revealing themselves to the world via a soft-launch social post or brazen red-carpet debut, Carpenter, 25, and Keoghan, 31, have done things their own way.

Supposedly meeting at Givenchy’s Spring/Summer 2024 show during Paris Fashion Week at the end of September 2023, the duo were first photographed getting cosy in December of that year, following the Saltburn star’s divorce from Alyson Kierans. By February, Carpenter and Keoghan had made their first public appearance together at W magazine‘s Grammys after-party.

Now, in a new interview with Vanity Fair, the songstress has opened up about dating in the public eye and what advice Taylor Swift had for her on the matter.

“It’s a lot of what I’m writing about, and it’s a lot of what inspires me,” she said of her love life making it into her songs. “I don’t think there’s ever a ‘how-to’ book on any of this stuff.”

But while many of her songs touch on love and relationships, she affirmed that she divulges much more.

“This is my diary. Once I put it out there, it’s for other people to interpret. I try to not tell people what a song is explicitly about,” she continued. “People don’t always know what’s going on inside the minds of anyone, let alone a young girl who’s navigating love and a lot of things for the first time.”

Carpenter, who served as the opening act for Swift’s mammoth Eras Tour, was also asked whether Swift gave her any advice about handling public relationships. As Swift has a long history of dealing with her love life being in the press, it seems only fitting that the two would bond over this part of their lives.

“On a personal level, she’s really been there for me, and I’m so grateful,” she told the outlet. “That’s something she’s taught me really well—she has remained very human throughout all of it.”
