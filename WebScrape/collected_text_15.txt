Sabrina Carpenter showed off her incredible figure as she graced the stage at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend on Sunday in Luton.

The Espresso hitmaker, 25, pulled out all the stops in a plunging orange mini dress as she performed alongside the likes of Coldplay and Olly Alexander at Stockwood Park.

The singer teamed the number with white knee-high socks and matching platform heels.







Sabrina appeared mesmerised by the crowd's warm welcome, and pointed out: 'This is actually my first time performing in Luton.

'Is it OK if I call you Lulu?,' to which fans screamed in approval and the star declared: 'Lulu it is!'

The pop sensation looked in her element as she took to the stage with confidence, performing a slew of best hits including her latest banger Espresso.

Sabrina displayed her dance moves while also delighting fans with her incredible vocal skills on some of her hits including Vicious, Read Your Mind and Tornado Warnings.

The Pennsylvania-born superstar sent fans into frenzy with her vibrant performance - as she keeps making the most of her glory after her latest single Espresso topped charts as UK number one single, even outclassing Taylor Swift.

Earlier this month, Sabrina was left thrilled as Adele revealed she is a huge fan of her music while performing during her Las Vegas residency.

The 16-time Grammy Award winner, 36, took a break from her setlist to speak to the crowd and heaped on praise to Sabrina.

She explained how she headed back to her hotel late after one of her shows and she found herself singing the lyrics to Sabrina's hit song Espresso. 

While sitting on a piano stool on stage, Adele broke into the catchy tune and gushed, 'it's my jam'.

The Hello singer said: 'As I got into bed last night, because [it] was a very late night for me, I found myself singing "I'm working late, cus I'm a singer", that Sabrina Carpenter song — that song is my jam!

Sabrina's new track even outperformed Taylor Swift in the charts 

'It came out when I couldn't sing. So all last night that's all I've been singing.' 

The former Disney actress, who opened for Taylor Swift in Latin America, Asia and Australia on her Eras Tour, couldn't believe the news and quickly retweeted an article sharing the moment. 

Sabrina joked: 'All I read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.'

The Nonsense singer also re-shared a clip to her Instagram and wrote: 'Um guys can someone check on me.' 

Fans were quick to take to the comments to say 'Adele really is like all of us' and commended her for 'giving props to other artists'. 

'You know you’ve made it when Adele has your song stuck in your head'; 'I love how Adele gives props to other artists so freely. She’s a girls' girl.'

'Adele is my spirit animal tbh'; 'Adele really is all of us'; 'Imagine an Adele x Sabrina collab tho.'

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry Keoghan, 31.

The singer and Saltburn actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. 

Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. 

When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 

'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.'

The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship.  

Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.'

Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. 

In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet.

Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn.

Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival.

Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022. The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year.

When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.'

Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo.

The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina.

'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina.

In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

Espresso is a great tune! But her voice is not very strong at all.

She looks just like Hayden Panettierre, and reminds me of just another barely talented ex-Disney actress.

The pop sensation looked in her element as she took to the stage with confidence, performing a slew of best hits including her latest banger Espresso.

Sabrina displayed her dance moves while also delighting fans with her incredible vocal skills on some of her hits including Vicious, Read Your Mind and Tornado Warnings.

The Pennsylvania-born superstar sent fans into frenzy with her vibrant performance - as she keeps making the most of her glory after her latest single Espresso topped charts as UK number one single, even outclassing Taylor Swift.

Earlier this month, Sabrina was left thrilled as Adele revealed she is a huge fan of her music while performing during her Las Vegas residency.

The 16-time Grammy Award winner, 36, took a break from her setlist to speak to the crowd and heaped on praise to Sabrina.

She explained how she headed back to her hotel late after one of her shows and she found herself singing the lyrics to Sabrina's hit song Espresso. 

While sitting on a piano stool on stage, Adele broke into the catchy tune and gushed, 'it's my jam'.

The Hello singer said: 'As I got into bed last night, because [it] was a very late night for me, I found myself singing "I'm working late, cus I'm a singer", that Sabrina Carpenter song — that song is my jam!

Sabrina's new track even outperformed Taylor Swift in the charts 

'It came out when I couldn't sing. So all last night that's all I've been singing.' 

The former Disney actress, who opened for Taylor Swift in Latin America, Asia and Australia on her Eras Tour, couldn't believe the news and quickly retweeted an article sharing the moment. 

Sabrina joked: 'All I read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.'

The Nonsense singer also re-shared a clip to her Instagram and wrote: 'Um guys can someone check on me.' 

Fans were quick to take to the comments to say 'Adele really is like all of us' and commended her for 'giving props to other artists'. 

'You know you’ve made it when Adele has your song stuck in your head'; 'I love how Adele gives props to other artists so freely. She’s a girls' girl.'

'Adele is my spirit animal tbh'; 'Adele really is all of us'; 'Imagine an Adele x Sabrina collab tho.'

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry Keoghan, 31.

The singer and Saltburn actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. 

Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. 

When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 

'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.'

The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship.  

Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.'

Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. 

In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet.

Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn.

Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival.

Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022. The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year.

When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.'

Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo.

The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina.

'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina.

In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

She looks just like Hayden Panettierre, and reminds me of just another barely talented ex-Disney actress.

The pop sensation looked in her element as she took to the stage with confidence, performing a slew of best hits including her latest banger Espresso.

Sabrina displayed her dance moves while also delighting fans with her incredible vocal skills on some of her hits including Vicious, Read Your Mind and Tornado Warnings.

The Pennsylvania-born superstar sent fans into frenzy with her vibrant performance - as she keeps making the most of her glory after her latest single Espresso topped charts as UK number one single, even outclassing Taylor Swift.

Earlier this month, Sabrina was left thrilled as Adele revealed she is a huge fan of her music while performing during her Las Vegas residency.

The 16-time Grammy Award winner, 36, took a break from her setlist to speak to the crowd and heaped on praise to Sabrina.

She explained how she headed back to her hotel late after one of her shows and she found herself singing the lyrics to Sabrina's hit song Espresso. 

While sitting on a piano stool on stage, Adele broke into the catchy tune and gushed, 'it's my jam'.

The Hello singer said: 'As I got into bed last night, because [it] was a very late night for me, I found myself singing "I'm working late, cus I'm a singer", that Sabrina Carpenter song — that song is my jam!

Sabrina's new track even outperformed Taylor Swift in the charts 

'It came out when I couldn't sing. So all last night that's all I've been singing.' 

The former Disney actress, who opened for Taylor Swift in Latin America, Asia and Australia on her Eras Tour, couldn't believe the news and quickly retweeted an article sharing the moment. 

Sabrina joked: 'All I read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.'

The Nonsense singer also re-shared a clip to her Instagram and wrote: 'Um guys can someone check on me.' 

Fans were quick to take to the comments to say 'Adele really is like all of us' and commended her for 'giving props to other artists'. 

'You know you’ve made it when Adele has your song stuck in your head'; 'I love how Adele gives props to other artists so freely. She’s a girls' girl.'

'Adele is my spirit animal tbh'; 'Adele really is all of us'; 'Imagine an Adele x Sabrina collab tho.'

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry Keoghan, 31.

The singer and Saltburn actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. 

Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. 

When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 

'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.'

The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship.  

Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.'

Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. 

In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet.

Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn.

Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival.

Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022. The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year.

When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.'

Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo.

The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina.

'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina.

In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

She looks just like Hayden Panettierre, and reminds me of just another barely talented ex-Disney actress.

Sabrina Carpenter showed off her incredible figure as she graced the stage at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend on Sunday in Luton.

The Espresso hitmaker, 25, pulled out all the stops in a plunging orange mini dress as she performed alongside the likes of Coldplay and Olly Alexander at Stockwood Park.

The singer teamed the number with white knee-high socks and matching platform heels.







Sabrina appeared mesmerised by the crowd's warm welcome, and pointed out: 'This is actually my first time performing in Luton.

'Is it OK if I call you Lulu?,' to which fans screamed in approval and the star declared: 'Lulu it is!'

The pop sensation looked in her element as she took to the stage with confidence, performing a slew of best hits including her latest banger Espresso.

Sabrina displayed her dance moves while also delighting fans with her incredible vocal skills on some of her hits including Vicious, Read Your Mind and Tornado Warnings.

The Pennsylvania-born superstar sent fans into frenzy with her vibrant performance - as she keeps making the most of her glory after her latest single Espresso topped charts as UK number one single, even outclassing Taylor Swift.

Earlier this month, Sabrina was left thrilled as Adele revealed she is a huge fan of her music while performing during her Las Vegas residency.

The 16-time Grammy Award winner, 36, took a break from her setlist to speak to the crowd and heaped on praise to Sabrina.

She explained how she headed back to her hotel late after one of her shows and she found herself singing the lyrics to Sabrina's hit song Espresso. 

While sitting on a piano stool on stage, Adele broke into the catchy tune and gushed, 'it's my jam'.

The Hello singer said: 'As I got into bed last night, because [it] was a very late night for me, I found myself singing "I'm working late, cus I'm a singer", that Sabrina Carpenter song — that song is my jam!

Sabrina's new track even outperformed Taylor Swift in the charts 

'It came out when I couldn't sing. So all last night that's all I've been singing.' 

The former Disney actress, who opened for Taylor Swift in Latin America, Asia and Australia on her Eras Tour, couldn't believe the news and quickly retweeted an article sharing the moment. 

Sabrina joked: 'All I read was Adele thinks about me in bed <3.'

The Nonsense singer also re-shared a clip to her Instagram and wrote: 'Um guys can someone check on me.' 

Fans were quick to take to the comments to say 'Adele really is like all of us' and commended her for 'giving props to other artists'. 

'You know you’ve made it when Adele has your song stuck in your head'; 'I love how Adele gives props to other artists so freely. She’s a girls' girl.'

'Adele is my spirit animal tbh'; 'Adele really is all of us'; 'Imagine an Adele x Sabrina collab tho.'

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry Keoghan, 31.

The singer and Saltburn actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. 

Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. 

When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 

'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.'

The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship.  

Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.'

Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. 

In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet.

Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. 

The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn.

Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival.

Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022. The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year.

When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.'

Earlier this month, Sabrina was left thrilled as Adele revealed she is a huge fan of her music while performing during her Las Vegas residency

Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo.

The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina.

'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina.

In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

Espresso is a great tune! But her voice is not very strong at all.

She looks just like Hayden Panettierre, and reminds me of just another barely talented ex-Disney actress.

Sabrina Carpenter clinched the top spot on the UK Singles Chart with her hit "Espresso" from Island Records, marking its fourth consecutive week at the pinnacle. 

Officially confirmed on Friday, May 24, the track not only secured the lead but also remained the most-streamed song in the UK, amassing over 8.3 million plays this past week.

Meanwhile, Billie Eilish's new album "Hit Me Hard And Soft" made a strong debut on the UK Albums Chart, securing the second highest opening of the year, just behind Taylor Swift's "The Tortured Poets Department."

Eilish also saw significant success on the singles front, with three tracks from her album entering the top 10. 


The lead single "Lunch" debuted impressively at No. 2, followed by "Chihiro" at No. 7 and "Birds Of A Feather" at No. 9, elevating her career total of UK top 10 singles to 12.

Adding to the top 10 mix, Shaboozey's "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" held its ground at No. 3, contributing to a diverse country flavor in this week's chart that includes tracks from Post Malone and Morgan Wallen, and Dasha's steady "Austin."

Further down the list, Gunna debuted his "One of Wun" at No. 32, marking another top 40 hit for the US rapper. 

Tems also made notable strides with "Love Me JeJe," which climbed to No. 39, marking her fourth U.K. top 40 entry.

In a nostalgic twist, Disturbed's cover of "The Sound of Silence" re-entered the chart at No. 39, fueled by a viral dance remix. 

This cover, originally a hit in 2016, pays homage to the Simon and Garfunkel classic, adding a modern twist to a timeless track.
