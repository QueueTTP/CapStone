Wednesday, May 1, 2024CARPENTER'S "ESPRESSO" FLOATS TO #1
Island's Sabrina Carpenter has earned her first global #1 with "Espresso," which topped Spotify's worldwide and U.S. charts on 4/29. The fast-moving track racked up 9.8m worldwide streams yesterday, surpassing the Taylor Swift/Post Malone giant "Fortnight."

Sabrina dropped the new tune just before Coachella. Her buzzy sets in Indio paired with the pop banger quickly dominated social media. How long can Carpenter's hit hold court at #1? Could another big look boost the song further? "Espresso" is certainly a strong contender for song of the summer, and Imran Majid, Justin Eshak and team are feeling more caffeinated than ever. Pass the biscotti.

Barry Keoghan & Sabrina Carpenter: A Complete Relationship Timeline
By Kara Nesvig, Kaitlyn McNab, and Sara Delgado
August 30, 2024

From dating rumors to multiple sightings together, Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan have truly given us it all.

Since late 2023, the Emails I Can't Send singer and Saltburn star have been seen out together in Los Angeles on multiple different occasions, sparking dating rumors across social media based on a few blurry, sneakily-taken pics. They've since double dated with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, shared red carpet appearances, and even acted in Carpenter's “Please Please Please” music video together. And like any celebrity relationship, theirs has been plagued by breakup rumors — though a couple recent posts from Keoghan are all about support for the Short 'n Sweet singer.


Check out Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's full relationship timeline below.

Aug. 29, 2024: Barry Keoghan shares his favorite Short 'n Sweet Song
As rumors continued to float that Carpenter and Keoghan may have broken things off, Keoghan chimed in with an Instagram Story about his favorite song on Carpenter's album: “Bed Chem.”

“BED CHEM my fave just sayin m'darlin @sabrinacarpenter,” he wrote on IG alongside some choice emojis and a photo from Carpenter's IG. Like a good supportive boyfriend, he also shared the streaming link for the record.

If there's one thing Barry Keoghan is going to do, it's gas up Sabrina Carpenter in the comment section; it doesn't matter if the original post features the singer herself or a doll in her likeness. To celebrate the release of the music video for “Taste,” off Carpenter's sixth studio album Short n' Sweet, Bratz recreated one of the Death Becomes Her-inspired looks Carpenter and her on-screen partner Jenna Ortega wear in the video.

After seeing Bratz's post, Keoghan did not hesitate to take to the comments section to write: “Can I have one?” Keoghan's comment sent fans into a frenzy after weeks of speculation that the pair had potentially broken up or taken a more casual approach to their relationship.

August 18, 2024: Source says Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan are “on and off”
As fans speculated about a potential breakup based on a jokey TikTok posted by Sabrina Carpenter, a source told People that the duo's relationship is now more casual, and the pair is “on and off.”

People noted that Keoghan seemed to have quashed breakup rumors by liking Carpenter's most recent Instagram post, which sees the singer posing in baby blue lingerie to promote her album Short n’ Sweet, while Carpenter skirted around a question about her relationship status in an interview with Rolling Stone from June.

“The [dating] pool is the pool, and when you meet people that feel authentic and are so brilliant and amazing in every way, that’s what you do,” Carpenter said. "Obviously, I write songs about exactly how I feel, so I guess I can’t be so surprised that people are interested in who and what those songs are about. That’s something that comes with the territory.”

August 6, 2024: Sabrina Carpenter calls Barry Keoghan “one of the best actors of this generation”

In her Variety cover story, Sabrina Carpenter took the chance to sing Barry Keoghan's praises when asked about his involvement in the “Please Please Please” music video and his reaction to the song, which came out in June.

“He loved the song," Carpenter admitted. “He’s obsessed with the lyrics, and I’m so grateful for that.” She added: "I don’t want to sound biased, but I think he’s one of the best actors of this generation. So getting to see him on the screen with my song as the soundtrack made the video better and all the more special.”

Another day, another video of Barry Keoghan being completely mesmerized by Sabrina Carpenter. After a few busy months in the U.S., the duo traveled across the pond with Keoghan accompanying Carpenter as she took the stage at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend 2024 festival held in Luton, England.

Carpenter was among the many performers of the weekend, which also included Coldplay, Charli XCX, and Vampire Weekend, and Keoghan made sure to show up in support, watching from the side stage with a smile he couldn't hide even as tech equipment blocked his view. In fan videos from the night, the Irish actor can be seen in an all-purple ‘fit watching Carpenter perform her viral hit “Espresso.” Much like Keoghan, she also favored one color in her own ’fit, wearing an orange Roberto Cavalli dress from 2005. You can see Keoghan's grin below:

The 2024 Oscars might have been Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan's first public event together, with the couple taking over the Vanity Fair photo booth and posing together for a picture at one of the after parties, but their official joint red carpet debut arrived during the 2024 Met Gala, with the duo posing together for pictures after reaching the top of the Met stairs.

April 1, 2024: Keoghan reacts on main to Carpenter's SKIMS campaign.

Sabrina Carpenter is the newest face of SKIMS, and some fans — *cough* Barry Keoghan *cough* — couldn't contain their reactions. For the new Y2K-inspired spring campaign, Carpenter is photographed lounging around a bedroom in babydoll lace lingerie listening to CDs on a Walkman, talking on a cordless landline phone, and channel surfing, awash in the blue glow of a TV.

The photos really are something, and Carpenter's rumored boyfriend seems to agree. Barry Keoghan left his own flirty two cents amidst comments from other stars like Kehlani and Julia Michaels, writing “🔥🥵 barbie emoji,” he wrote. (At the time of publishing, the Irish actor's comment has over 24,000 likes.) A few scrolls down, one fan of Carpenter asked the million dollar question: “Keoghan can u fight?" QTNA.

March 27, 2024: Carpenter reveals her “type” when it comes to dating.
While gracing the cover of the latest issue of Cosmo, Carpenter took the opportunity to explain her dating approach and reveal whether she has a “type” when it comes to romantic partners. The singer says she has “never, ever, ever, ever” landed a date from a dating app and generally avoids app culture in preference of organic meet-cutes “through friends.” She attributes the majority of her dating life to “fate and chance.”

“A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that’s super broad, but I don’t actively look for it,” Carpenter said in her cover story interview. “The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it’s fun and it’s messy. I think I’m still just at this place where I’m really enjoying the newness of all of it.”

In an editor's note, Cosmopolitan clarified the timeline of their interview: Carpenter spoke to the outlet in early January, when rumors of her relationship with Barry Keoghan had just started to pick up steam. (Click here to catch yourself up on the SaBarry lore.) Enjoying the newness, indeed. When asked what her “type” is, Carpenter said personality stands out to her more than looks.

“Contrary to popular opinion, I don’t think I have a type. But the internet loves to just put pictures next to each other of men who have the same hair color," she said. “I’m super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends, because I want to be with someone who’s going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humor and being genuine. I will say I’ve always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.” Carpenter and Keoghan are always spotted smiling and laughing, so, from the looks of it, she's on the right track.

March 11, 2024: Keoghan wears a Taylor Swift Eras tour shirt to run errands with Carpenter.
Just one day after making their joint public event debut as a couple during Oscars night, Carpenter and Keoghan did the second-most chic activity one can do in Hollywood: running errands.

The couple was spotted on the morning of March 12 in Los Angeles during various stops around the city, and Keoghan's particular choice of attire is receiving a lot of attention. The Saltburn actor stepped out wearing a T-shirt from Taylor Swift's official Eras Tour merch, which he paired with black sweatpants and a pair of white Nike Air Force 1s. Carpenter picked Keoghan up in her car donning an equally comfy ‘fit, opting for a burgundy cap, a grey Betty Boop t-shirt, ripped baggy jeans, and a pair of black UGG platform boots. You can see the couple’s full looks here.

The moment we have all been waiting for has finally arrived: Barry Keoghan and Sabrina Carpenter made their public event debut at the Vanity Fair Oscars 2024 after party. After the Oscars 2024 ceremony, the two stars made their way to the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Beverly Hills for the after party and posed together at the event.

Though Keoghan and Carpenter walked the red carpet separately, the duo linked up before heading into the actual party and posed together for the camera in what is now the first official photo we have of them together. Keoghan and Carpenter were snapped just to the side of the red carpet as they made their way into the venue, and, of course, the couple chose matching poses for the special snap. The two stars covered the bottom half of their faces with their left hands. And before you ask, yes, Keoghan was once again wearing his “Sabrina” friendship bracelet.

Thanks to a video captured by Variety, we also know this is not the only picture Keoghan and Carpenter got together during the Vanity Fair Oscars party. The entertainment publication caught the two stars taking a quick selfie together while still on the red carpet — though Carpenter was quite obviously trying to be super nonchalant about it all.

But that's not all! We also got a video of Keoghan saying he was “distracted” while posing solo for the photographers because Carpenter was right in front of him. Cheeky. Big night for Hollywood and big night for #SaBarry, indeed! (Also, did we mention they also got super love-dovey inside the Vanity Fair photo booth?)

March 2–4, 2024: Keoghan supports Carpenter during the Eras Tour stops in Singapore and reacts to her NSFW “Nonsense” outro.

To kick off March, Sabrina Carpenter traveled all the way to Singapore for the new leg of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, and she was in good company. Keoghan was spotted on the grounds at the Singapore National Stadium in Kallang supporting his rumored girlfriend.

Though he flew under the radar during the first night, Keoghan took center stage the following night. That's right, it's finally happened: Barry Keoghan has seemingly made it onto one of Sabrina Carpenter's “Nonsense” outros — and, luckily for us, someone filmed his full reaction.

ICYMI: Since the release of “Nonsense” in 2022, Carpenter has made it a habit to wrap the song with an ad-libbed outro every time she performs it live. During the second show in Singapore on March 3, Carpenter seemingly dedicated her outro to Keoghan, singing: "He said that he wishes he was on me. Got me wetter than the Jewel Changi. Singapore, I hope you like my songy.” (In case you need a little help understanding just how NSFW Carpenter's ad-lib is, we'll leave you with a picture of Jewel Changi's famous waterfall here.)

In the original fan video of Keoghan's reaction, taken by X user @chleng, we see the actor paying close attention to Carpenter's new lyrics while covering his mouth with a VIP lanyard pass and tilting his head at the aforementioned lyric. After a second, the actor doesn't hesitate to erupt in a cheer for the star, raising his hands above his head to clap. (Of course, the clip has spread like wildfire on the app.)

But that's not all. On March 4, for the third night of the Singaporean leg of the tour, Keoghan and Carpenter were filmed sharing a sweet hug. As captured in a fan video that is now also making the rounds on X, Keoghan was patiently waiting for Carpenter backstage after her set and held back for approximately 0.1 seconds before hugging her tightly as soon as she made her way to him. (To add even more to the cute moment, the pair were clad in matching black clothes.)

February 24, 2024: Keoghan comments a cute emoji of support under Carpenter's tour post.
Screenshot/Instagram @sabrinacarpenter
On February 24, Taylor Swift surprised her Eras Tour crowd in Sydney with a Sabrina Carpenter duet of “White Horse” and “Coney Island." That night, Carpenter posted about the special moment in an Instagram dump, writing in her caption: “9 year old Sabrina singing ‘White Horse’ would never see this sh*t coming! I love you so so so dearly Taylor. Always have always will. Thank you Sydney for making me feel so welcome!!”

Fans and friends of Carpenter flooded the comment with sweet reactions, but perhaps the most notable comment was a singular emoji from a certain Irish actor. Barry Keoghan praised Carpenter's performance with a queen emoji — his comment on the carousel has nearly 12,000 likes at the time of writing. Does this mean we might see Keoghan at one of the upcoming Singapore Eras shows, the last stretch of Carpenter's opener slot on the tour, or in the desert crowd at Coachella 2024 to support his rumored GF? Only time will tell…

February 13, 2024: Paparazzi catch Carpenter and Keoghan all smiles on a West Hollywood date night.

A few days before Valentine's Day, Carpenter and Keoghan were seen once again on a romantic night out in Los Angeles, this time wining and dining at popular West Hollywood date spots Delilah and Ysabel. People caught the (potential) couple cheesing and open-mouth laughing on the sidewalk, looking extremely smitten — see the exclusive photos here. Carpenter wore a black mini dress and knee-high boots while her man friend donned a red bomber jacket, white tee, olive pants, and white sneakers.

February 9, 2024: Carpenter and Keoghan are seen kissing the morning after another dinner date.

God, these two love a dinner date, huh? On a Friday evening in February, People reports that Carpenter and Keoghan were seen having dinner together at Nobu and heading to the Hotel Bel-Air afterwards. According to the outlet, Keoghan then dropped Carpenter off at her home the next morning and were seen kissing farewell. A weekend of love!

January 15, 2024: Carpenter and Keoghan “share a little kiss” at Luna Luna.

The pop star and Oscar-nominated actor were spotted at Luna Luna, the interactive museum amusement park in Los Angeles on January 15. In the pics, Carpenter wears an all-black outfit, and Keoghan dons black pants and a varsity-style jacket. They're standing together, but they're not holding hands or cuddling, either. While we can't say for sure if they were on a date or just hanging out and checking out some art, it certainly seems like they were there together. And according to one eyewitness, there might have even been a kiss. “It definitely seemed like a date,” the spectator told People, adding that Keoghan and Carpenter looked “cute” and “shared a little kiss.”

January 9, 2024: Keoghan confirms split from his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his son.

Barry Keoghan, who is 31 years old, was previously in a long-term relationship with Alyson Sandro. The two share a young son named Brando. However, they reportedly split in July 2023; in Keoghan's January 2024 GQ cover story, he declined to comment on their breakup. He told the outlet: “She’s done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.” Period.

January 7, 2024: Carpenter is rumored to attend the 2024 Golden Globes as Keoghan's date.

About a month later in early January 2024, a rumor began circulating online that Carpenter would be attending the 2024 Golden Globes with Keoghan as his date, which later turned out to be false. (Keoghan flew solo for the awards show.)

December 3, 2023: Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan are seen leaving a “romantic” dinner together in L.A.

In early December 2023, The Daily Mail reported that Carpenter and Keoghan were seen together in a Los Angeles parking lot, where they were reportedly leaving a “romantic” dinner together. This all, of course, hinges on a few low-res photos of the two walking towards a car.

In the paparazzi pics, both the actor and the musician are dressed casually, with Keoghan in a henley and Carpenter wearing a leather trench, jeans, and a bow in her hair. Maybe they're friends. Maybe they were on a date. Maybe they were just hanging out in the same vicinity and Keoghan dropped her off because they're neighbors. We truly don't know.

March 2023: Shawn Mendes shuts down Sabrina Carpenter dating rumors.

After the two were seen out and about and grabbing dinner together in Los Angeles in early spring 2023, Sabrina Carpenter was romantically linked to fellow pop singer Shawn Mendes. However, Mendes shot down the rumors in March 2023, telling RTL Boulevard that the pair were “not dating.”

24-year-old Carpenter had also previously been linked to High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star Joshua Bassett. (Their relationship was supposedly the inspiration for a few songs by Olivia Rodrigo, who was also rumored to have dated Bassett.)

Billboard Hot 100: Every #1 song of 2024

Daniel Montgomery

shaboozey bet awards 2024Christopher Polk for Billboard

The Billboard Hot 100 singles chart measures the most popular songs every week from Friday to Thursday based on the combination of their sales, online streams (audio and video), and radio airplay. Below is the list of every song that came out on top in 2024, updated weekly as each new chart is announced.

SEEGrammy Album of the Year: All the Winners in Grammy Awards History
Shaboozey, “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”
7 weeks at number-one
July 13; July 27 – August 31


This is Shaboozey’s first number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100. It’s also the first song by a Black man to top the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts at the same time. Previously, Beyonce made history as the first Black artist of any gender to achieve that with “Texas Hold ‘Em” (see below).


Sabrina Carpenter, “Please Please Please”
1 week at number-one
June 29


Carpenter achieves the very first number-one single of her career. Her previous best was her ubiquitous hit “Espresso,” which has so far peaked at number-three. The week prior to ascending to the top spot, this song debuted at number-two on the chart. Both “Please” and “Espresso” are featured on Carpenter’s album “Short ‘n Sweet.”

Post Malone feat. Morgan Wallen, “I Had Some Help”
6 weeks at number-one
May 25 – June 22; July 6


This is the sixth number-one hit for Malone and the second for Wallen. The genre-bending Malone also achieves his first ever number-one single on the Hot Country Songs chart. This is also Malone’s second song to debut at number-one in just four weeks, following “Fortnight,” his collab with Taylor Swift (see below).

Kendrick Lamar, “Not Like Us”
2 weeks at number-one
May 18; July 20


This is Lamar’s fourth number-one hit and his second chart-topper unaccompanied by another artist, following “Humble.” This diss track is part of his longstanding feud with fellow rapper Drake. The two artists have traded tracks and accusations back and forth, but this single came out on top while Drake’s “Family Matters” debuted at number-seven.

Taylor Swift feat. Post Malone, “Fortnight”
2 weeks at number-one
May 4 – May 11


The lead single from her album “The Tortured Poets Department” debuted at number-one the same week the album dropped. It’s the 12th number-one hit of her career, which ranks her sixth among all artists. “Tortured Poets” launched all of its 31 tracks onto the Hot 100, including a sweep of the top 14 slots on the chart. Meanwhile, Post Malone achieves his fifth number-one hit.

Hozier, “Too Sweet”
1 week at number-one
April 27


This is the first number-one single of Hozier’s career, doing one spot better than his previous high water mark, “Take Me to Church,” which peaked at number-two. It’s also the fifth hit by an Irish artist to ascend to the top.


Future, Metro Boomin and Kendrick Lamar, “Like That”
3 weeks at number-one
April 6 – April 20


This is the third number-one hit for Future, the third for Kendrick Lamar, and the first for Metro Boomin as a credited recording artist; Metro previously topped the chart twice as a writer/producer. In its debut week, the single achieved the most weekly streams for any song since Miley Cyrus‘s “Flowers” in 2023. “Like That” debuted in the top spot the same week its parent album, Metro and Future’s “We Don’t Trust You,” debuted atop the Billboard 200.

Teddy Swims, “Lose Control”
1 week at number-one
March 30


This is Swims’s first song to chart on the Hot 100 and his first to reach number-one. It took 32 weeks on the chart for the song to finally ascend to the top, which is longest road to number-one for any male solo artist.

Ariana Grande, “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)”
1 week at number-one
March 23


This is Ariana Grande’s ninth number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and the second from her album “Eternal Sunshine,” which a few weeks earlier sent “Yes, And?” to the top of the chart. It’s Grande’s seventh song to debut at the top, which is the most ever among women. Max Martin achieves his record-extending 25th number-one hit as a producer.

Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign feat. Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti, “Carnival”
1 week at number-one
March 16


This is Kanye West’s fifth number-one single, Ty Dolla $ign’s second and the first for both Rich the Kid and Playboi Carti. West becomes the first rapper to score number-one singles in the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s. West also has the longest span of number-one hits for a rap artist.


Beyonce, “Texas Hold ‘Em”
2 weeks at number-one
March 2 – March 9


This is Beyonce’s ninth number-one hit as a solo artist. It’s also her historic first chart-topper on the Hot Country Songs chart: she’s the first Black woman ever to lead that survey. “Texas Hold ‘Em” was released alongside “16 Carriages” as the lead singles from her new album scheduled for release on March 29.

Megan Thee Stallion, “Hiss”
1 week at number-one
February 10


This diss track debuted at number-one. It’s Megan Thee Stallion’s third song to reach the top spot, following “Savage” with Beyonce and “WAP” with Cardi B. This is her first solo number-one.

Ariana Grande, “Yes, And?”
1 week at number-one
January 27


This is the eighth Grande song to top the chart and her sixth to debut at number-one. It also makes history for producer Max Martin, who achieves his 24th number-one hit, the most of any producer in Hot 100 history. Half of Grande’s chart-toppers have been collaborations. This is just her fourth hit to reach the summit without another credited artist, following “Thank U Next,” “7 Rings” and “Positions.”

Jack Harlow, “Lovin on Me”
5 weeks at number-one in 2024 (6 weeks total)
January 13 – January 20; February 3; February 17 – February 24


After all the holiday songs dropped off the chart in the week after Christmas, Harlow’s single leaped up from number-nine back to number-one after previously spending a week on top in December. It’s his third chart-topper, following “Industry Baby” with Lil Nas X and “First Class.” It’s also his longest-running chart-topper.

Brenda Lee, “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree”
1 week at number-one in 2024 (3 weeks total)
January 6


The classic holiday song reached number-one during the 2023 holiday season. It was the song’s first time ever at the top a remarkable 65 years after its release way back in 1958. This is just the third holiday song ever to top the chart, following The Chipmunks and David Seville’s “The Chipmunk Song” and Mariah Carey‘s “All I Want for Christmas is You.” It’s also Brenda Lee’s third song to reach the pinnacle. “Rockin’ Around” spent a total of three weeks on top during this competitive holiday period.

SEEMariah Carey number-one songs, ranked from worst to best: All 19 chart-topping hits

The Billboard Hot 100 has tracked the industry’s most popular music since back in 1958, starting with the very first number-one hit, Ricky Nelson‘s “Poor Little Fool.” Since then more than 1,100 songs have reached the top, though Billboard’s methodology has evolved over the years as the music industry and technology have advanced.

For example, sales were once tracked by Nielsen from Monday to Sunday, but in 2015 that changed to Friday to Thursday. Also, in the earlier years of the charts, sales were given more weight than radio airplay because single purchases were much more common than they have been lately. That changed as full-length albums became more prevalent and single sales went down. Similarly, in 1998 Billboard updated its rules again to allow a song to appear on the Hot 100 even if it was airplay-only and wasn’t available to purchase. In 2007 Billboard began counting audio streaming performance towards the Hot 100. And in 2013 YouTube video streams were added to the formula, bringing the chart more in line with how music is consumed in the modern era.

The Beatles hold the record for the most number-one hits with 20 different chart-toppers. They’re followed closely by Mariah Carey, who has had 19 songs reach numberthe summit. Carey’s 1995 duet with Boyz II Men, “One Sweet Day,” set the record for the most weeks at number-one with 16. That record stood for more than two decades before it was tied by “Despacito” by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber in 2017, and then ultimately broken by Lil Nas X, whose “Old Town Road” featuring Billy Ray Cyrus dominated the chart for 19 weeks in 2019. But the song named by Billboard as the number-one of all time was The Weeknd‘s “Blinding Lights,” which spent only four weeks at number-one but shattered the record for the most weeks in the top 10 with more than a year in that upper echelon.
