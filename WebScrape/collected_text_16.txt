The stunning style transformation of Sabrina Carpenter

FASHION
The Stunning Style Transformation Of Sabrina Carpenter
BY JELENA ASKAJUNE 2, 2024 9:15 AM EST
Frazer Harrison/Getty Images
From her career beginnings as a Disney Channel star to her current fame as a chart-topping musician, Sabrina Carpenter has captured the attention and the hearts of fans across the world with her singing and acting talent, charm, and undeniable sense of style. But before we dive into her style journey, let's remember that Carpenter's fashion evolution is about more than just her clothes — it's a reflection of her journey as an artist and an individual.

ADVERTISEMENT
Born in 1999 in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, Carpenter knew early on what she wanted her life to look like, and she certainly made that happen. As Carpenter's career exploded, so did her sense of style — and with each passing year, she has wowed us with even more memorable fashion moments. From her boho-chic era to her unforgettable revival of the '90s skinny fringe, Carpenter has proven that fashion is a game she definitely knows how to play.

2011-2012: Tween Sabrina Carpenter makes her debut in the industry, and just like that, a new child star is born
Joe Seer/Shutterstock & Jonathan Leibson/Getty
In 2011, 12-year-old Sabrina Carpenter burst onto the entertainment scene as she began her journey to stardom. Although her big breakthrough had yet to happen, Carpenter was already making waves in the industry. The tween's first acting role came in 2011 when she appeared as a guest on "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." The following year, Carpenter landed herself lead roles in two TV movies, and in pursuit of her dreams, moved from her hometown of Pennsylvania to Los Angeles. "The difference is crazy. There are a lot of doors in LA — some open, some slam in your face. In Pennsylvania, I was living in my own world, where I could create everything around me," Carpenter shared with Vanity Fair in 2017.

"I knew this is where I'd end up," she admitted. "I was that kid who dreamed about it but knew it wasn't always going to be just a dream." During this time, Carpenter's style was youthful, fun, and quirky, reflecting her bubbly personality and sense of adventure. From fingerless gloves to intricate stockings — Carpenter's early 2010s style was all about finding what she liked as a soon-to-be teen. She wasn't afraid to switch up her look, even dyeing her hair copper at one point. This set the stage for the true trendsetter she would become later on.

2013: The teen gets cast by the Disney Channel, and her style follows suit
Araya Doheny & Paul Archuleta/Getty
In January 2013, Sabrina Carpenter's life changed forever when she was cast in the Disney Channel show "Girl Meets World," a spin-off of the beloved '90s hit "Boy Meets World." This role of Maya Hart marked a significant milestone in her career and catapulted her to fame as a Disney Channel star. Now officially part of the Disney family, Carpenter had big shoes to fill, following in the footsteps of stars like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Zendaya, all of whom had become fashion icons since their breakthroughs.

With her newfound fame came a heightened interest in her personal style. Carpenter's fashion sense during this time was all about mixing and matching, embracing the trends of early 2010s fashion. In fact, lace or crochet tops and flowy and fun bottoms were a staple in the young star's closet at the time. As she settled into her role as a Disney Channel star, her fashion choices continued to evolve, and it was clear even back then that Carpenter wasn't afraid of experimenting.

2014-2015: Long locks and boho clothing are Sabrina Carpenter's signature style as she enters the music scene
Paul Redmond & Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty
Sabrina Carpenter's style began to change as she ventured into the music scene, embracing long, messy locks and boho-inspired clothing. In the spring of 2014, she released her debut single, "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying," marking her official entry into the music industry. Reflecting on her journey in 2014 with Yahoo! Music, Carpenter shared, "My favorite thing before going to school was watching 'Full House,' 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch,' and 'Boy Meets World.' After the audition process, it was a sigh of relief: 'I finally got here!' I was very determined."

As Carpenter's music career took off, so did her sense of style. She embraced a boho-teen aesthetic and was often seen wearing flowing dresses and floral patterns. Her fashion choices mirrored her free-spirited personality and laid-back approach to life while also reflecting her love for music and creativity. Speaking of her debut album, Carpenter added, "I did a lot of my own songs for the full album, just a growth and maturity in my voice," she revealed. "Lot of finding myself, listening to new styles."

2016: 17-year-old Sabrina Carpenter embraces an edgier aesthetic, and her fans are here for it
Monica Schipper & Nicholas Hunt/Getty
In 2016, Sabrina Carpenter underwent a major style transformation, embracing an even edgier, more daring aesthetic — much to the delight of her fans. Black eyeshadow looks, black leather, and bold cutouts became the norm for the young star. Perhaps her best fashion moment of the year happened at the Billboard Women In Music event, to which she showed up in a fun Fausto Puglisi outfit that combined leather and denim elements. At the time, the combination of oversized jackets and delicate tops was making its way into fashion — popularized by stars like Rihanna, who carried the trend — and there's no denying that Carpenter pulled the look off effortlessly as well.

Carpenter's personal style became more grown up, helping her to pave the way for her future in the industry. It was clear that in the second half of the 2010s, Carpenter was going to part ways with her child-star style to embrace the young woman she was growing into.

2017: Sabrina Carpenter says goodbye to Disney as she focuses on music with true pop-star style

Sabrina Carpenter slowly bid farewell to her Disney days as she focused on her music career, embracing a true pop-star style that ensured she was always the center of attention. Reflecting on her style, Carpenter shared a memorable fashion moment from 2017 with Glamour: the pink Céline dress she wore to Billboard Women in Music event. "When I saw it, I thought, That will literally look like a rag on me," the star recalled. "When we put it on, I was like, 'OK. I'm getting more into this. I'm feeling a little like Princess Aurora.'"

Transitioning from her Disney image to that of a rising pop star, Carpenter's style blossomed. She played around with infusing more color into her wardrobe, daring silhouettes, and eye-catching accessories, giving confidence and sophistication on the red carpet and beyond. "These past few years have been my experimental phase ... So I'm expressing myself in what I wear — I'm able to put on a different persona every single time," Carpenter told Vanity Fair that year. For Carpenter, fashion became a form of self-expression, allowing her to explore different facets of her personality. "The fun part has been finding what really connects to me, and the pieces I feel most comfortable and confident wearing, because I think that says something about you."

At the age of 19, Sabrina Carpenter continued embracing unconventional pieces and daring combinations that set her apart from the crowd. As she grew more comfortable in her own skin, Carpenter began creating looks that were uniquely her own. Reflecting on the power of fashion, Carpenter told Glamour in 2018, "You really remember where [someone was] in their career based on their look and the trends that they started. That's so powerful." Despite her growing fame and success, she also acknowledged the difficulty of finding trusted individuals to help curate her wardrobe. "It's always so, so hard to find people that you trust enough to allow them to pick out things for you that you would never pick out yourself," she admitted.

It was evident that Carpenter's journey into fashion was a success once the young star began being invited to the most prestigious fashion shows in the industry. In 2018, she attended the Versace Pre-Fall 2019 Runway Show alongside stars like Kim Kardashian and Blake Lively. For the occasion, Carpenter dazzled in a stunning skirt and jacket set designed by Donatella Versace. "Luckily, in the lane of what I do, I'm able to take risks a lot," she added. "Because I'm 18, I get to have a lot of fun and [face] a little less judgment than I would if I was older." With her fun attitude and eye-catching style, Carpenter was quickly becoming a fashion icon to watch.

In 2019, Sabrina Carpenter continued to dazzle both on the red carpet and in her everyday street style, effortlessly switching from cool and casual to sophisticated and chic. Despite her petite frame, Carpenter wasn't afraid to have fun with her fashion choices. She collaborated with stylist Jason Bolden, who helped her navigate the world of fashion and step outside of her comfort zone. "... if there's ever something that I am really envisioning, he's the first person to be like, 'Got it, got it, got it. Let's try this' and throw something new my way in the shortest period of time," Carpenter shared with Fashionista, reflecting on their relationship the following year. And at the Billboard Music Awards, she caught everyone's attention in a black Rasario draped jumpsuit with delicate sequins around the bust.

Carpenter's street style also underwent a transformation, beginning in 2018 and carrying on into the 2020s. "For the past six months, no matter what store I go into, I shop in the men's section first," she shared with Glamour. "I need to branch out with colors more because I sometimes stick to what I know best." Inspired by edgy fashion icons like Rihanna, Carpenter admitted that her motto is embracing bold looks. "There's this really funny meme that says, 'It was ugly until Rihanna decided that it wasn't,'" she said. "I never leave my house [dressed like] Rihanna, but I strive to be that kind of bold." And while Rihanna remains a major style icon in her own right, we have to acknowledge that Sabrina Carpenter is carving her niche for her self in the world of fashion quite successfully.

Sabrina Carpenter made her Broadway debut in "Mean Girls," but unfortunately, the show was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During her few industry appearances in 2020, Carpenter channeled a more sophisticated and feminine style, showcasing her fashion versatility. For public appearances, she went with flirty and fun minidresses, plenty of sequins, and her signature long loose waves. Even though we were going through difficult and unprecedented times, Carpenter inspired her fans by having fun with fashion — even if it was just for social media. "No one's going to the ball right now," she told Fashionista. "No one's going out to any clubs. There's no pressure other than to have fun, and if you feel like you love it, then you can capture it and share it. If you don't, no one ever has to know that you wore it."

The star also acknowledged that the looks she chooses to rock on stage aren't just quickly put together. "I really do think there's something so obvious about the stuff that I gravitate towards as far as my tour and performance stage outfits. It's myself, but it's heightened," Carpenter said. "It's the little girl who's always liked to dress up her entire life." While she wasn't touring at the time, as the world was in lockdown, soon her stage outfits would become a major part of her fame. At the end of 2020, Carpenter earned a spot on Forbes' "30 Under 30" list for 2021 as one of the names that was changing Hollywood.

2021: Sabrina Carpenter's iconic bangs make an entrance as she has even more fun with fashion

Sabrina Carpenter made a bold style statement with her iconic bangs. Her hairstylist Scott King shared insights into creating Carpenter's signature bangs in 2024: "We blow-dry the bangs first side-to-side with a medium-sized round brush. After it's dry and still warm, we take a medium-sized Velcro roller, roll it toward the face, and secure it while styling the rest of the hair for about 10 minutes," he told Fashionista, after her signature style had become iconic in celebrity beauty circles.

Carpenter's fashion choices became even more daring in 2021 as she continued to channel different decades. "I do love taking inspiration from films, old films from different decades before," she revealed to Fashionista. "There was a day I felt like I wanted to do a full '70s throwback, just a flare jean and more of like a form-fitted Penny Lane tee." While her style took inspiration from the past, Carpenter's looks were still very modern around this time, with a hint of vintage here and there. In fact, making a statement was still a major part of her fashion journey, and at the 2021 Fenty Fashion Show, she showed up on the red carpet in a simple oversized white tee with an effortlessly tied belt around her waist — a look that was so casual it could have easily looked out of place. Yet, with her now-famous bangs, the actor and musician continued her fearless approach to style, proving that fashion isn't there to put you in a certain box.

As we entered 2022, it became undeniable that Sabrina Carpenter had everything a true pop star needs. While she perfectly fit the mold of a talented singer, Carpenter won fans over with her personality, which was impossible to ignore — whether showcased through her music and performances, social media presence, or constantly evolving style. Over the years, she has evolved from a Disney darling into an entertainment industry star, proving that she is here to stay.

Now 22 years old, Carpenter fearlessly embraced her sensuality, unapologetically wearing fashion pieces that she knew would make her the center of attention. For the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022, the star decided to rock a retro-looking Moschino flower dress, enhancing it even more by pairing it with a matching retro '70s hairstyle. Then at the 2022 Fashion Awards held in London, the star wowed in a hooded Alberta Ferretti gown which gave her a dystopian and unexpected look, proving just how multifaceted her fashion is. While she began her career following early 2010s trends as a tween, a decade later, Carpenter was the one setting them. Although she had already achieved so much, the following years would propel her even further into the spotlight.

Sabrina Carpenter embraced a new flirty and feminine style that captured the hearts of her fans everywhere — and yes, hearts played a major role in her style. Rocking lots of whites and baby pinks, platform Bratz-like heels, glitter fashion, bows, frills, and miniskirts, Carpenter's fashion choices became more playful and vibrant than ever before. "This theme of hearts [is] sprinkled throughout the music and different visuals," the musician told Who What Wear. "It made so much sense to me because [the album] was so deeply surrounded by this infatuation with love and the lack of love and [how it helped to shape] me into the person that I am right now," Carpenter added, referring to her fifth studio album, "Emails I Can't Send." "There have been a lot of little heart cutouts. I've pretty much done it everywhere."

Her style evolution coincided with a significant career milestone as she became the opening act for Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour." The exposure from touring with Swift helped Carpenter catapult into even bigger stardom, solidifying her status as one of the most exciting young talents in the industry. Reflecting on the experience, Carpenter shared, "I'm not gonna say I peed my pants because that sounds really graphic and maybe not sanitary, but I think it really just caught me off guard. It was very much a childhood dream come true."

The Most Embarrassing Royal Outfit Mishaps
BY JELENA ASKAUPDATED: JUNE 11, 2024 9:26 AM EST
Static Media/Shutterstock/Getty
Ah, the world of royalty, where elegance, grace, and impeccable style reign. We often think of duchesses, princesses, and queens as fashion icons, draped in luxurious fabrics and wearing outfits that seem untouched by the trials and tribulations of mere mortals. Yet, beneath the carefully curated facade of tiaras and ball gowns, the truth peeks through — even the most regal of figures occasionally struggle with fashion's impulsive quirks.

ADVERTISEMENT
While fashion-forward figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle reign supreme in the world of royal fashion, the truth is that they, too, can have wardrobe malfunctions. The tiara may gleam and the gown may shimmer, but these royal ladies (and their family members) aren't immune to the occasional peekaboo bra, the unanticipated flash of shapewear, or even the embarrassing oversight of a forgotten price tag.

So join us on a journey through some of the most unforgettable and endearing mishaps to grace the royal catwalk. These stories remind us that, even amidst all the glitz and glam, laughter and the occasional blush are just as much a part of the royal wardrobe as satin and silk. In the world of royals, where every detail is meticulously planned, these charmingly imperfect moments are a reminder that even the most glamorous of figures are, at heart, delightfully human.

The Stunning Style Transformation Of Sabrina Carpenter
BY JELENA ASKAJUNE 2, 2024 9:15 AM EST
Frazer Harrison/Getty Images
From her career beginnings as a Disney Channel star to her current fame as a chart-topping musician, Sabrina Carpenter has captured the attention and the hearts of fans across the world with her singing and acting talent, charm, and undeniable sense of style. But before we dive into her style journey, let's remember that Carpenter's fashion evolution is about more than just her clothes — it's a reflection of her journey as an artist and an individual.

ADVERTISEMENT
Born in 1999 in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, Carpenter knew early on what she wanted her life to look like, and she certainly made that happen. As Carpenter's career exploded, so did her sense of style — and with each passing year, she has wowed us with even more memorable fashion moments. From her boho-chic era to her unforgettable revival of the '90s skinny fringe, Carpenter has proven that fashion is a game she definitely knows how to play.

In 2011, 12-year-old Sabrina Carpenter burst onto the entertainment scene as she began her journey to stardom. Although her big breakthrough had yet to happen, Carpenter was already making waves in the industry. The tween's first acting role came in 2011 when she appeared as a guest on "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." The following year, Carpenter landed herself lead roles in two TV movies, and in pursuit of her dreams, moved from her hometown of Pennsylvania to Los Angeles. "The difference is crazy. There are a lot of doors in LA — some open, some slam in your face. In Pennsylvania, I was living in my own world, where I could create everything around me," Carpenter shared with Vanity Fair in 2017.

"I knew this is where I'd end up," she admitted. "I was that kid who dreamed about it but knew it wasn't always going to be just a dream." During this time, Carpenter's style was youthful, fun, and quirky, reflecting her bubbly personality and sense of adventure. From fingerless gloves to intricate stockings — Carpenter's early 2010s style was all about finding what she liked as a soon-to-be teen. She wasn't afraid to switch up her look, even dyeing her hair copper at one point. This set the stage for the true trendsetter she would become later on.

In January 2013, Sabrina Carpenter's life changed forever when she was cast in the Disney Channel show "Girl Meets World," a spin-off of the beloved '90s hit "Boy Meets World." This role of Maya Hart marked a significant milestone in her career and catapulted her to fame as a Disney Channel star. Now officially part of the Disney family, Carpenter had big shoes to fill, following in the footsteps of stars like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Zendaya, all of whom had become fashion icons since their breakthroughs.

With her newfound fame came a heightened interest in her personal style. Carpenter's fashion sense during this time was all about mixing and matching, embracing the trends of early 2010s fashion. In fact, lace or crochet tops and flowy and fun bottoms were a staple in the young star's closet at the time. As she settled into her role as a Disney Channel star, her fashion choices continued to evolve, and it was clear even back then that Carpenter wasn't afraid of experimenting.

Sabrina Carpenter's style began to change as she ventured into the music scene, embracing long, messy locks and boho-inspired clothing. In the spring of 2014, she released her debut single, "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying," marking her official entry into the music industry. Reflecting on her journey in 2014 with Yahoo! Music, Carpenter shared, "My favorite thing before going to school was watching 'Full House,' 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch,' and 'Boy Meets World.' After the audition process, it was a sigh of relief: 'I finally got here!' I was very determined."

As Carpenter's music career took off, so did her sense of style. She embraced a boho-teen aesthetic and was often seen wearing flowing dresses and floral patterns. Her fashion choices mirrored her free-spirited personality and laid-back approach to life while also reflecting her love for music and creativity. Speaking of her debut album, Carpenter added, "I did a lot of my own songs for the full album, just a growth and maturity in my voice," she revealed. "Lot of finding myself, listening to new styles."

In 2016, Sabrina Carpenter underwent a major style transformation, embracing an even edgier, more daring aesthetic — much to the delight of her fans. Black eyeshadow looks, black leather, and bold cutouts became the norm for the young star. Perhaps her best fashion moment of the year happened at the Billboard Women In Music event, to which she showed up in a fun Fausto Puglisi outfit that combined leather and denim elements. At the time, the combination of oversized jackets and delicate tops was making its way into fashion — popularized by stars like Rihanna, who carried the trend — and there's no denying that Carpenter pulled the look off effortlessly as well.

Carpenter's personal style became more grown up, helping her to pave the way for her future in the industry. It was clear that in the second half of the 2010s, Carpenter was going to part ways with her child-star style to embrace the young woman she was growing into.

Reflecting on her style, Carpenter shared a memorable fashion moment from 2017 with Glamour: the pink Céline dress she wore to Billboard Women in Music event. "When I saw it, I thought, That will literally look like a rag on me," the star recalled. "When we put it on, I was like, 'OK. I'm getting more into this. I'm feeling a little like Princess Aurora.'"

Transitioning from her Disney image to that of a rising pop star, Carpenter's style blossomed. She played around with infusing more color into her wardrobe, daring silhouettes, and eye-catching accessories, giving confidence and sophistication on the red carpet and beyond.

So I'm expressing myself in what I wear — I'm able to put on a different persona every single time," Carpenter told Vanity Fair that year. For Carpenter, fashion became a form of self-expression, allowing her to explore different facets of her personality.

Sabrina Carpenter made her Broadway debut in "Mean Girls," but unfortunately, the show was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During her few industry appearances in 2020, Carpenter channeled a more sophisticated and feminine style, showcasing her fashion versatility. For public appearances, she went with flirty and fun minidresses, plenty of sequins, and her signature long loose waves. Even though we were going through difficult and unprecedented times, Carpenter inspired her fans by having fun with fashion — even if it was just for social media. "No one's going to the ball right now," she told Fashionista. "No one's going out to any clubs. There's no pressure other than to have fun, and if you feel like you love it, then you can capture it and share it. If you don't, no one ever has to know that you wore it."

The star also acknowledged that the looks she chooses to rock on stage aren't just quickly put together. "I really do think there's something so obvious about the stuff that I gravitate towards as far as my tour and performance stage outfits. It's myself, but it's heightened," Carpenter said. "It's the little girl who's always liked to dress up her entire life." While she wasn't touring at the time, as the world was in lockdown, soon her stage outfits would become a major part of her fame. At the end of 2020, Carpenter earned a spot on Forbes' "30 Under 30" list for 2021 as one of the names that was changing Hollywood.

After it's dry and still warm, we take a medium-sized Velcro roller, roll it toward the face, and secure it while styling the rest of the hair for about 10 minutes," he told Fashionista, after her signature style had become iconic in celebrity beauty circles.

Carpenter's fashion choices became even more daring in 2021 as she continued to channel different decades. "I do love taking inspiration from films, old films from different decades before," she revealed to Fashionista. "There was a day I felt like I wanted to do a full '70s throwback, just a flare jean and more of like a form-fitted Penny Lane tee." While her style took inspiration from the past, Carpenter's looks were still very modern around this time, with a hint of vintage here and there. In fact, making a statement was still a major part of her fashion journey, and at the 2021 Fenty Fashion Show, she showed up on the red carpet in a simple oversized white tee with an effortlessly tied belt around her waist — a look that was so casual it could have easily looked out of place. Yet, with her now-famous bangs, the actor and musician continued her fearless approach to style, proving that fashion isn't there to put you in a certain box.

As we entered 2022, it became undeniable that Sabrina Carpenter had everything a true pop star needs. While she perfectly fit the mold of a talented singer, Carpenter won fans over with her personality, which was impossible to ignore — whether showcased through her music and performances, social media presence, or constantly evolving style. Over the years, she has evolved from a Disney darling into an entertainment industry star, proving that she is here to stay.

Now 22 years old, Carpenter fearlessly embraced her sensuality, unapologetically wearing fashion pieces that she knew would make her the center of attention. For the MTV Video Music Awards in 2022, the star decided to rock a retro-looking Moschino flower dress, enhancing it even more by pairing it with a matching retro '70s hairstyle. Then at the 2022 Fashion Awards held in London, the star wowed in a hooded Alberta Ferretti gown which gave her a dystopian and unexpected look, proving just how multifaceted her fashion is. While she began her career following early 2010s trends as a tween, a decade later, Carpenter was the one setting them. Although she had already achieved so much, the following years would propel her even further into the spotlight.

Sabrina Carpenter embraced a new flirty and feminine style that captured the hearts of her fans everywhere — and yes, hearts played a major role in her style. Rocking lots of whites and baby pinks, platform Bratz-like heels, glitter fashion, bows, frills, and miniskirts, Carpenter's fashion choices became more playful and vibrant than ever before. "This theme of hearts [is] sprinkled throughout the music and different visuals," the musician told Who What Wear. "It made so much sense to me because [the album] was so deeply surrounded by this infatuation with love and the lack of love and [how it helped to shape] me into the person that I am right now," Carpenter added, referring to her fifth studio album, "Emails I Can't Send." "There have been a lot of little heart cutouts. I've pretty much done it everywhere."

Her style evolution coincided with a significant career milestone as she became the opening act for Taylor Swift's "Eras Tour." The exposure from touring with Swift helped Carpenter catapult into even bigger stardom, solidifying her status as one of the most exciting young talents in the industry. Reflecting on the experience, Carpenter shared, "I'm not gonna say I peed my pants because that sounds really graphic and maybe not sanitary, but I think it really just caught me off guard. It was very much a childhood dream come true."

Today, Sabrina Carpenter exudes such confidence in her skin, inspiring her fans to feel good. As she continues to evolve as an actor and musician, so does her sense of style. "The things I feel really confident in now, maybe five years ago, I probably would have never worn [them], but that's the beautiful thing about evolving with fashion," she told Who What Wear. From her Coachella ultra short miniskirt to her Oscar de la Renta Met Gala look, one thing that doesn't change no matter what she is wearing is her unwavering confidence.

Over the past decade, Carpenter has carved out her own spot in the world of entertainment, fashion, and music. The star knows that fashion not only helped her become more famous but it also makes her feel like the boss she is. "I want to feel as confident as humanly possible so I can be up there and not worry about what I'm doing," Carpenter admitted. "It helps me perform better." And with her fun and bold approach to fashion, we can't help but wonder where her style journey goes next. One thing is sure: Just like the rest of the world, we'll be eagerly watching.

The Most Embarrassing Royal Outfit Mishaps
BY JELENA ASKAUPDATED: JUNE 11, 2024 9:26 AM EST
Static Media/Shutterstock/Getty
Ah, the world of royalty, where elegance, grace, and impeccable style reign. We often think of duchesses, princesses, and queens as fashion icons, draped in luxurious fabrics and wearing outfits that seem untouched by the trials and tribulations of mere mortals. Yet, beneath the carefully curated facade of tiaras and ball gowns, the truth peeks through — even the most regal of figures occasionally struggle with fashion's impulsive quirks.

ADVERTISEMENT
While fashion-forward figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle reign supreme in the world of royal fashion, the truth is that they, too, can have wardrobe malfunctions. The tiara may gleam and the gown may shimmer, but these royal ladies (and their family members) aren't immune to the occasional peekaboo bra, the unanticipated flash of shapewear, or even the embarrassing oversight of a forgotten price tag.

So join us on a journey through some of the most unforgettable and endearing mishaps to grace the royal catwalk. These stories remind us that, even amidst all the glitz and glam, laughter and the occasional blush are just as much a part of the royal wardrobe as satin and silk. In the world of royals, where every detail is meticulously planned, these charmingly imperfect moments are a reminder that even the most glamorous of figures are, at heart, delightfully human.

The Stunning Style Transformation Of Sabrina Carpenter
BY JELENA ASKAJUNE 2, 2024 9:15 AM EST
Frazer Harrison/Getty Images
From her career beginnings as a Disney Channel star to her current fame as a chart-topping musician, Sabrina Carpenter has captured the attention and the hearts of fans across the world with her singing and acting talent, charm, and undeniable sense of style. But before we dive into her style journey, let's remember that Carpenter's fashion evolution is about more than just her clothes — it's a reflection of her journey as an artist and an individual.

ADVERTISEMENT
Born in 1999 in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, Carpenter knew early on what she wanted her life to look like, and she certainly made that happen. As Carpenter's career exploded, so did her sense of style — and with each passing year, she has wowed us with even more memorable fashion moments. From her boho-chic era to her unforgettable revival of the '90s skinny fringe, Carpenter has proven that fashion is a game she definitely knows how to play.

2011-2012: Tween Sabrina Carpenter makes her debut in the industry, and just like that, a new child star is born

In 2011, 12-year-old Sabrina Carpenter burst onto the entertainment scene as she began her journey to stardom. Although her big breakthrough had yet to happen, Carpenter was already making waves in the industry. The tween's first acting role came in 2011 when she appeared as a guest on "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." The following year, Carpenter landed herself lead roles in two TV movies, and in pursuit of her dreams, moved from her hometown of Pennsylvania to Los Angeles. "The difference is crazy. There are a lot of doors in LA — some open, some slam in your face. In Pennsylvania, I was living in my own world, where I could create everything around me," Carpenter shared with Vanity Fair in 2017.

"I knew this is where I'd end up," she admitted. "I was that kid who dreamed about it but knew it wasn't always going to be just a dream." During this time, Carpenter's style was youthful, fun, and quirky, reflecting her bubbly personality and sense of adventure. From fingerless gloves to intricate stockings — Carpenter's early 2010s style was all about finding what she liked as a soon-to-be teen. She wasn't afraid to switch up her look, even dyeing her hair copper at one point. This set the stage for the true trendsetter she would become later on.

In January 2013, Sabrina Carpenter's life changed forever when she was cast in the Disney Channel show "Girl Meets World," a spin-off of the beloved '90s hit "Boy Meets World." This role of Maya Hart marked a significant milestone in her career and catapulted her to fame as a Disney Channel star. Now officially part of the Disney family, Carpenter had big shoes to fill, following in the footsteps of stars like Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Zendaya, all of whom had become fashion icons since their breakthroughs.

With her newfound fame came a heightened interest in her personal style. Carpenter's fashion sense during this time was all about mixing and matching, embracing the trends of early 2010s fashion. In fact, lace or crochet tops and flowy and fun bottoms were a staple in the young star's closet at the time. As she settled into her role as a Disney Channel star, her fashion choices continued to evolve, and it was clear even back then that Carpenter wasn't afraid of experimenting.

Sabrina Carpenter's style began to change as she ventured into the music scene, embracing long, messy locks and boho-inspired clothing. In the spring of 2014, she released her debut single, "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying," marking her official entry into the music industry. Reflecting on her journey in 2014 with Yahoo! Music, Carpenter shared, "My favorite thing before going to school was watching 'Full House,' 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch,' and 'Boy Meets World.' After the audition process, it was a sigh of relief: 'I finally got here!' I was very determined."

As Carpenter's music career took off, so did her sense of style. She embraced a boho-teen aesthetic and was often seen wearing flowing dresses and floral patterns. Her fashion choices mirrored her free-spirited personality and laid-back approach to life while also reflecting her love for music and creativity. Speaking of her debut album, Carpenter added, "I did a lot of my own songs for the full album, just a growth and maturity in my voice," she revealed. "Lot of finding myself, listening to new styles."

In 2016, Sabrina Carpenter underwent a major style transformation, embracing an even edgier, more daring aesthetic — much to the delight of her fans. Black eyeshadow looks, black leather, and bold cutouts became the norm for the young star. Perhaps her best fashion moment of the year happened at the Billboard Women In Music event, to which she showed up in a fun Fausto Puglisi outfit that combined leather and denim elements. At the time, the combination of oversized jackets and delicate tops was making its way into fashion — popularized by stars like Rihanna, who carried the trend — and there's no denying that Carpenter pulled the look off effortlessly as well.

Carpenter's personal style became more grown up, helping her to pave the way for her future in the industry. It was clear that in the second half of the 2010s, Carpenter was going to part ways with her child-star style to embrace the young woman she was growing into.

Sabrina Carpenter slowly bid farewell to her Disney days as she focused on her music career, embracing a true pop-star style that ensured she was always the center of attention. Reflecting on her style, Carpenter shared a memorable fashion moment from 2017 with Glamour: the pink Céline dress she wore to Billboard Women in Music event. "When I saw it, I thought, That will literally look like a rag on me," the star recalled. "When we put it on, I was like, 'OK. I'm getting more into this. I'm feeling a little like Princess Aurora.'"

Transitioning from her Disney image to that of a rising pop star, Carpenter's style blossomed. She played around with infusing more color into her wardrobe, daring silhouettes, and eye-catching accessories, giving confidence and sophistication on the red carpet and beyond. "These past few years have been my experimental phase ... So I'm expressing myself in what I wear — I'm able to put on a different persona every single time," Carpenter told Vanity Fair that year. For Carpenter, fashion became a form of self-expression, allowing her to explore different facets of her personality. "The fun part has been finding what really connects to me, and the pieces I feel most comfortable and confident wearing, because I think that says something about you."

At the age of 19, Sabrina Carpenter continued embracing unconventional pieces and daring combinations that set her apart from the crowd. As she grew more comfortable in her own skin, Carpenter began creating looks that were uniquely her own. Reflecting on the power of fashion, Carpenter told Glamour in 2018, "You really remember where [someone was] in their career based on their look and the trends that they started. That's so powerful." Despite her growing fame and success, she also acknowledged the difficulty of finding trusted individuals to help curate her wardrobe. "It's always so, so hard to find people that you trust enough to allow them to pick out things for you that you would never pick out yourself," she admitted.

It was evident that Carpenter's journey into fashion was a success once the young star began being invited to the most prestigious fashion shows in the industry. In 2018, she attended the Versace Pre-Fall 2019 Runway Show alongside stars like Kim Kardashian and Blake Lively. For the occasion, Carpenter dazzled in a stunning skirt and jacket set designed by Donatella Versace. "Luckily, in the lane of what I do, I'm able to take risks a lot," she added. "Because I'm 18, I get to have a lot of fun and [face] a little less judgment than I would if I was older." With her fun attitude and eye-catching style, Carpenter was quickly becoming a fashion icon to watch.

In 2019, Sabrina Carpenter continued to dazzle both on the red carpet and in her everyday street style, effortlessly switching from cool and casual to sophisticated and chic. Despite her petite frame, Carpenter wasn't afraid to have fun with her fashion choices. She collaborated with stylist Jason Bolden, who helped her navigate the world of fashion and step outside of her comfort zone. "... if there's ever something that I am really envisioning, he's the first person to be like, 'Got it, got it, got it. Let's try this' and throw something new my way in the shortest period of time," Carpenter shared with Fashionista, reflecting on their relationship the following year. And at the Billboard Music Awards, she caught everyone's attention in a black Rasario draped jumpsuit with delicate sequins around the bust.

Carpenter's street style also underwent a transformation, beginning in 2018 and carrying on into the 2020s. "For the past six months, no matter what store I go into, I shop in the men's section first," she shared with Glamour. "I need to branch out with colors more because I sometimes stick to what I know best." Inspired by edgy fashion icons like Rihanna, Carpenter admitted that her motto is embracing bold looks. "There's this really funny meme that says, 'It was ugly until Rihanna decided that it wasn't,'" she said. "I never leave my house [dressed like] Rihanna, but I strive to be that kind of bold." And while Rihanna remains a major style icon in her own right, we have to acknowledge that Sabrina Carpenter is carving her niche for her self in the world of fashion quite successfully.

2020: The musician embraces a more sophisticated and chic aesthetic (but with a youthful twist)

Sabrina Carpenter made her Broadway debut in "Mean Girls," but unfortunately, the show was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During her few industry appearances in 2020, Carpenter channeled a more sophisticated and feminine style, showcasing her fashion versatility. For public appearances, she went with flirty and fun minidresses, plenty of sequins, and her signature long loose waves. Even though we were going through difficult and unprecedented times, Carpenter inspired her fans by having fun with fashion — even if it was just for social media. "No one's going to the ball right now," she told Fashionista. "No one's going out to any clubs. There's no pressure other than to have fun, and if you feel like you love it, then you can capture it and share it. If you don't, no one ever has to know that you wore it."

The star also acknowledged that the looks she chooses to rock on stage aren't just quickly put together. "I really do think there's something so obvious about the stuff that I gravitate towards as far as my tour and performance stage outfits. It's myself, but it's heightened," Carpenter said. "It's the little girl who's always liked to dress up her entire life." While she wasn't touring at the time, as the world was in lockdown, soon her stage outfits would become a major part of her fame. At the end of 2020, Carpenter earned a spot on Forbes' "30 Under 30" list for 2021 as one of the names that was changing Hollywood.

2021: Sabrina Carpenter's iconic bangs make an entrance as she has even more fun with fashion
Jamie Mccarthy & Emma Mcintyre/Getty
Sabrina Carpenter made a bold style statement with her iconic bangs. Her hairstylist Scott King shared insights into creating Carpenter's signature bangs in 2024: "We blow-dry the bangs first side-to-side with a medium-sized round brush. After it's dry and still warm, we take a medium-sized Velcro roller, roll it toward the face, and secure it while styling the rest of the hair for about 10 minutes," he told Fashionista, after her signature style had become iconic in celebrity beauty circles.

Carpenter's fashion choices became even more daring in 2021 as she continued to channel different decades. "I do love taking inspiration from films, old films from different decades before," she revealed to Fashionista. "There was a day I felt like I wanted to do a full '70s throwback, just a flare jean and more of like a form-fitted Penny Lane tee." While her style took inspiration from the past, Carpenter's looks were still very modern around this time, with a hint of vintage here and there. In fact, making a statement was still a major part of her fashion journey, and at the 2021 Fenty Fashion Show, she showed up on the red carpet in a simple oversized white tee with an effortlessly tied belt around her waist — a look that was so casual it could have easily looked out of place. Yet, with her now-famous bangs, the actor and musician continued her fearless approach to style, proving that fashion isn't there to put you in a certain box.

Sabrina Carpenter embraced a new flirty and feminine style that captured the hearts of her fans everywhere — and yes, hearts played a major role in her style. Rocking lots of whites and baby pinks, platform Bratz-like heels, glitter fashion, bows, frills, and miniskirts, Carpenter's fashion choices became more playful and vibrant than ever before. "This theme of hearts [is] sprinkled throughout the music and different visuals," the musician told Who What Wear. "It made so much sense to me because [the album] was so deeply surrounded by this infatuation with love and the lack of love and [how it helped to shape] me into the person that I am right now," Carpenter added, referring to her fifth studio album, "Emails I Can't Send." "There have been a lot of little heart cutouts. I've pretty much done it everywhere."

Ah, the world of royalty, where elegance, grace, and impeccable style reign. We often think of duchesses, princesses, and queens as fashion icons, draped in luxurious fabrics and wearing outfits that seem untouched by the trials and tribulations of mere mortals. Yet, beneath the carefully curated facade of tiaras and ball gowns, the truth peeks through — even the most regal of figures occasionally struggle with fashion's impulsive quirks.

While fashion-forward figures like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle reign supreme in the world of royal fashion, the truth is that they, too, can have wardrobe malfunctions. The tiara may gleam and the gown may shimmer, but these royal ladies (and their family members) aren't immune to the occasional peekaboo bra, the unanticipated flash of shapewear, or even the embarrassing oversight of a forgotten price tag.

So join us on a journey through some of the most unforgettable and endearing mishaps to grace the royal catwalk. These stories remind us that, even amidst all the glitz and glam, laughter and the occasional blush are just as much a part of the royal wardrobe as satin and silk. In the world of royals, where every detail is meticulously planned, these charmingly imperfect moments are a reminder that even the most glamorous of figures are, at heart, delightfully human.

Meghan Markle's see-through skirt scandal

During the royal's tour of New Zealand in 2018, Meghan Markle's see-through skirt stole the spotlight. The Duchess of Sussex donned a dazzling royal blue ensemble, but the sheer skirt had its own agenda — revealing a bit more than intended. While fashion gaffes can happen to the best of us, it's rather surprising that no one on her fashion team caught this beforehand.

Kate Middleton's Marilyn Monroe moment

During her visit to India and Bhutan in 2016, Kate Middleton found herself battling a mighty opponent: the wind. Just like the iconic scene with Marilyn Monroe's billowing white dress, the Princess of Wales had to play a game of fashion tug-of-war to keep her outfit in check.

Princess Beatrice's very sheer dress

Princess Beatrice turned up the heat at the V&A Summer Party in 2017, but maybe a tad too much. In a move that surely had her family raising their royal eyebrows, the princess went all-in with a sheer ensemble that left little to the imagination. While the outfit might have been stunning on her, you can practically hear her family's collective sighs echoing through Buckingham Palace.

Princess Diana's choker headband blunder

While wearing a green satin gown, Princess Diana decided to switch things up by placing an emerald necklace on her head as a headband. Innovative? Absolutely. However, this creative twist might have left a few jaws dropped at this 1985 gala dinner dance. Princess Diana's daring style often hit the mark, but the necklace headband was a look she could have skipped.

Kate Middleton's dangerous wrap-tie dress

It seems even princesses have their brush with fashion hazards! Kate Middleton is usually known for her regal looks, but this time she found herself in a sticky situation with a wrap-tie dress. While visiting Hope House in 2013, the Princess of Wales was caught in another slightly comical tug-of-war game with her outfit as she was spotted tying her dress, which was determined to untie itself in a rebellious fashion.

Meghan Markle's red gown gone wrong

Attending the 2021 Salute To Freedom Gala, the Duchess of Sussex donned a fiery red gown that had all the makings of a showstopper. Yet, the 'fit seemed to have missed the royal mark. The waist and chest areas appeared to have had a conflict with the tailor's tape measure, leaving Meghan Markle in a dress that didn't quite give her the regal fit she deserved.

Princess Diana's wrinkled wedding dress

Princess Diana is a fashion icon, no doubt — from her iconic revenge dress to her royal wedding gown, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, which was a vision of elegance. But in her solo portrait from 1981, the train went rogue and decided to embrace wrinkles with open arms. In the magical world of royal weddings, you'd think wrinkles were banned, but even the most enchanting events can't seem to escape them.

Meghan Markle's lace bra mishap

The Duchess of Sussex was attending the wedding of Charlie Van Straubenzee in 2018 when her black button-up top decided to play a little peek-a-boo game. Just a tad rebellious, the top unbuttoned itself slightly, revealing her matching lace bra. Her outfit was undoubtedly royally chic, but this unexpected moment proves that everyone — including Meghan Markle — has this happen to them at least once.

Kate Middleton's creased Wimbledon fiasco

The Princess of Wales stepped onto Centre Court at Wimbledon in 2023 looking like a fashion ace in her splendid green dress. Alas, it seemed the dress wasn't quite prepared for the royal seating challenge. As the Gentlemen's Singles Final unfolded, the dress had some very noticeable creases around her hips. Someone who underwent a major style transformation like Kate Middleton should know that a wrinkle-resistant fabric would've saved the day.

Meghan Markle's bra outline

Meghan Markle found herself in a bit of a strapless snag during a visit with Irish President Michael Higgins in 2018. In what could only be described as a fashion faux pas, her choice of undergarments decided to make a bold appearance. The outline of her bra was clearly visible through her gray dress, making this look a bit more "transparent" than intended.

Kate Middleton's high-heel slip-up

Kate Middleton was all set for a St. Patrick's Day celebration in 2013 when her high heel decided to get stuck in the grating. Luckily, Prince William came to the rescue, lending a princely hand to free her footwear from the grating's grasp. A royal reminder that sometimes, even with all the grace in the world, heels and grates can still engage in battles of their own.

Queen Camilla's slip moment

Oh, windy woes strike again — this time, Camilla, Queen consort, found herself in a tango with the breeze while attending the NHS Heroes Awards in 2018. Just as she graced the red carpet, a gust of wind decided to lend a hand, revealing a royal secret: her shapewear. While the queen's presence is always graceful, this unexpected cameo from her shapewear surely added a touch of breezy drama to the evening.

Meghan Markle's stitched coat

By now, it's clear that the Duchess of Sussex can have a stitch of a surprise when it comes to fashion (don't mind our pun). During a 2018 visit to Birmingham with Prince Harry, the back bottom of Meghan Markle's coat decided to stay put, showing off its stubborn attachment. Let's just hope that nobody got fired after this fashion mistake!

Queen Camilla's battle with the wind

The wind seems to be a very common enemy of royal fashion, and the queen consort knows that too well. During the christening of Princess Charlotte in 2015, the winds decided to join the royal affair, and Queen Camilla had her hands full, quite literally! Her hat seemed to have ideas of its own, while her skirt yearned for the skies as well. The struggle was real as she danced a lively jig with the elements, proving that the wind doesn't really care who you are.

Meghan Markle's forgotten tag
Samir Hussein/Getty Images
In 2018, Meghan Markle touched down at Nuku'alofa airport in Tonga in a gorgeous red dress that undoubtedly turned heads. However, it seems that in the whirlwind of royal arrivals, a little tag drama decided to make its grand entrance, too, as the dress's price tag was still hanging around at the bottom.

Kate Middleton's back-to-front blouse

During one of Kate Middleton's visits to the Henry Fawcett Children's Centre in 2019, the royal donned a Gucci blouse with a little surprise: It was worn back-to-front! Perhaps the blouse wanted its moment in the spotlight, showcasing its buttons and design from a different angle. Either way, the Net-a-Porter description of the blouse says that it "features fabric-covered buttons that run down the back" (via Hello!).

Meghan Markle's muddy heels

Attending an Invictus Games Reception in 2018, the Duchess of Sussex found herself in a situation that many outdoor event-goers can relate to: muddy heels. Even though the terrain decided to play a little prank, Markle's heels embraced the earthiness and a coat of mud with pride. Sometimes, even in the world of tiaras and gowns, a dash of reality sneaks in — reminding us that muddy mishaps can grace even the most glamorous of them all.

Sabrina Carpenter’s Secret Formula For Songwriting
Sabrina Carpenter’s songs are some of the best pop music in recent memory. During an interview, the “Espresso” singer explained the first thing she does when she writes a song. She also revealed that she has mixed feelings about the expectations pop stars face.

Sabrina Carpenter begins writing songs with 1 thing

In a 2024 Interview Magazine article, Carpenter was asked how she came up with her song titles. “Ooh, good question,” she replied. “I choose the names of my songs by things I feel would jump out at me on a piece of paper, and usually my songs start with titles.” The “Nonsense” singer gave an interesting answer, as sometimes songwriters will only come up with song titles after the rest of their composition is complete.

Carpenter isn’t a big fan of the idea that pop songs have to be catchy and lyrically simple. The Work It star said...
