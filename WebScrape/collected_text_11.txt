Carpenter has partnered with PLUS1 on this tour to launch the Sabrina Carpenter Fund, which will support the well-being of people and animals, including national and local organizations working on the issues of mental health, animal welfare, and support for the LGBTQ+ community.

Nearly six albums into her career, Carpenter made Hot 100 history with her new single “Please Please Please” debuting at No. 2, and “Espresso” rising to a new peak of No. 3 on the list. The 25-year-old singer-songwriter became the first solo act in the history of the Billboard chart to land two simultaneous top-three hits without having previously charted in that realm.

“Please Please Please” was completed by a cinematic music video starring “Saltburn” star and Carpenter’s real-life boyfriend, Barry Keoghan. The song was co-written with Amy Allen, who also helped pen “Espresso.”

The singles will appear on her new album, “Short n’ Sweet,” due out Aug. 23. “This project is quite special to me and [I] hope it’ll be something special to you too,” she wrote on social media with the announcement. Half of the LP was produced by Jack Antonoff, along with returning collaborator, Julian Bunetta, as reported by Rolling Stone.

Carpenter released her fifth album “Emails I Can’t Send” in 2022, as well as its deluxe edition “Emails I Can’t Send Fwd” the following year. It became her highest-charting to date and boasted a hot single “Nonsense,” a song that caught fire after she provided alternate closing lyrics while opening for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in South America and Australia. She also toured the album on her own 80-date headlining world tour.

Though she’s been releasing music for a decade and acting even longer than that, Sabrina Carpenter has all of a sudden been the name on everyone’s tongues since her April single “Espresso” became a serious contender for Song of the Summer. It was released the day before she played Coachella, and — similar to Chappell Roan, whose pre-Coachella single “Good Luck, Babe!” Sabrina just did a cover of — she’s been rising very quickly since playing that festival. She was billed on the third line of its poster, but now she was just added to another major festival, Outside Lands, as a headliner, replacing Tyler, the Creator. (Chappell, for what it’s worth, is still on the second line of day three, which Sturgill Simpson headlines, but her crowd will obviously be huge.)

Sabrina will release her new album Short N’ Sweet on August 23 via Island Records (featuring “Espresso” and her more recent single “Please Please Please”), and she also announced that she’ll go on an arena tour from September through November. Part of that tour has support from the great Amaarae, including the show at NYC’s Madison Square Garden on September 29. Tickets go on sale Friday, June 28 at 10 AM local, with various presales starting Monday, June 24 at 10 AM local. See all dates below.

UPDATE: Sabrina added a second NYC show with Amaarae, to her tour, at Barclays Center on September 30.
