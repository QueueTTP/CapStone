‚ÄúMiss madame‚Äôs dress looking so boring like espresso,‚Äù a fan wrote.‚ÄúShe has the song of the summer yet she pulled this basic IJBOL,‚Äù another fan stated.‚ÄúMy girl I‚Äôm streaming espresso every day but this I can‚Äôt defend it, this is straight up boring for a Met look,‚Äù one fan wrote.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cute look but not for the Met like this doesn‚Äôt seem to match the theme at all unless it‚Äôs an archive pull but I doubt it,‚Äù a fan reacted.‚ÄúSlightly on theme and gorgeous but boring. She should have explored more,‚Äù one fan stated.‚ÄúHer hair looks incredible, her dress on the other hand is a little bit disappointing,‚Äù another X user wrote.

Irish star Barry Keoghan put on a show-stopping performance on the red carpet at the Met Gala in New York as he twirled his top hat for the cameras.

The Saltburn star attended the event with his girlfriend, Espresso singer Sabrina Carpenter.

Oscar nominee Keoghan appeared to take inspiration from the Victorian era as he sported an eye-catching look by Burberry, made up of an olive velvet tailored suit and waistcoat, teamed with a ruffled cream shirt with a necktie and a black top hat.

Northern Irish star Jamie Dornan made his Met Gala debut in a morning suit by Loewe, designed by fellow Northern Irishman Jonathan Anderson.

Irish designer Sean McGirr also got a show of support at the Met, with Lana Del Rey sporting one of his looks for Alexander McQueen.

The Video Games singer attended the event with the creative director, wearing a nude corseted dress embellished with hand-embroidered sequinned branches.

She wore a headpiece made up of real hawthorn branches, with swathes of see-through tulle covering her, and a red rose on her hand.

‚ÄúMiss madame‚Äôs dress looking so boring like espresso,‚Äù a fan wrote.‚ÄúShe has the song of the summer yet she pulled this basic IJBOL,‚Äù another fan stated.‚ÄúMy girl I‚Äôm streaming espresso every day but this I can‚Äôt defend it, this is straight up boring for a Met look,‚Äù one fan wrote.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cute look but not for the Met like this doesn‚Äôt seem to match the theme at all unless it‚Äôs an archive pull but I doubt it,‚Äù a fan reacted.‚ÄúSlightly on theme and gorgeous but boring. She should have explored more,‚Äù one fan stated.‚ÄúHer hair looks incredible, her dress on the other hand is a little bit disappointing,‚Äù another X user wrote.
