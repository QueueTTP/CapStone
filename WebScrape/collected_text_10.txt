Sabrina Carpenter & Barry Keoghan Share Kiss While Praising Met Gala Looks

Rumored couple Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan may not have walked the carpet together at the 2024 Met Gala, but a new video shows the pair seeing each other's looks for the first time and even sharing a sweet kiss.

Vogue shared a video of Carpenter getting ready for fashion's biggest night as part of its "Last Looks" series that featured a special appearance from the Academy Award-nominated actor. The sweet moment comes near the end of the video as Carpenter is getting her makeup touched up and she asks about the "special guest" before lighting up when she sees Keoghan walk into the room.

The actor couldn't hide his own excitement at seeing Carpenter in full glam, starting to curse before she told him he couldn't. As they embraced, Carpenter said she loved his look and he gave her a sweet kiss on the cheek.

Check out the video below.

Both the "Espresso" singer and the Saltburn actor looked amazing in their looks for the Met Gala, honoring the Costume Institute's new exhibit "Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion" and the "Garden of Time" dress code. Carpenter was angelic in a custom strapless black crushed-velvet gown with a light blue cloud-like satin skirt by Oscar de la Renta while Keoghan looked dapper in an olive velvet suit and waistcoat by Burberry with a ruffled silk shirt, boots and top hot, per People.

Carpenter and Keoghan were first romantically linked in late 2023 and sparked further romance rumors after they were spotted together at an after party following the 2024 Grammy Awards in February. The pair, who seemingly made their event debut at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in March, have since been seen together multiple times and have even left flirty comments on social media.

Sabrina Carpenter Scores 'Sweet' Chart Double In Australia
08/30/2024
The hottest debut this week belongs to Dua Lipa, whose third studio album Radical Optimism (Warner U.K./Warner) starts at No. 2. That’s the British artist’s third consecutive top 10 album in the land Down Under after Dua Lipa peaked at No. 8 in 2017 and Future Nostalgia logged three non-consecutive weeks atop the tally in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

Radical Optimism has a strong Aussie connection. Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker co-wrote and produced seven tracks on the collection, including the three hit singles “Houdini,” “Training Season” and “Illusion.”

SZA’s SOS (RCA/Sony) completes the ARIA Chart podium, down 2-3.

The top ranked homegrown release this week belongs to superstar singer Sia Furler whose Reasonable Woman (Atlantic/Warner) debuts at No. 14. Hailing from Adelaide, Sia has previously led the national chart on two occasions, with 1000 Forms Of Fear from 2014 and This Is Acting from 2016.

Over on the singles frame, Sabrina Carpenter’s Australian chart story perks up as “Espresso” lifts 2-1, for the U.S. singer and actor’s first leader in these parts. “Espresso” is also the current No. 1 in the U.K.

Rising U.S. singer and rapper Tommy Richman has a hit on his hands in Australia, as “Million Dollar Baby” (CONC) cashes from its viral turn on TikTok, up 33-2 on the ARIA Singles Chart.

Shaboozey’s country-leaning number “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” (EMP) completes the top three on the ARIA Singles Chart, unmoved at No. 3.

Finally, Kendrick Lamar has the top debuts as his Drake diss tracks, “Euphoria” (at No. 8 via Universal) and “Not Like Us” (at No. 9), both debut in the top 10.

Those controversial songs lift Lamar’s tally of Australian top 10 hits to 12, including his contribution to Taylor Swift’s 2015 chart-leader “Bad Blood.”

Sabrina Carpenter Is Pretty in Pink For Marc Jacobs’ Pre-Fall 2024 Campaign
She’s working late –– but this time, as a model.

Pop’s latest ‘it girl’ Sabrina Carpenter looks pretty in pink as the face of Marc Jacobs’ Pre-Fall 2024 campaign. Channeling her inner Barbie for the shoot, we see the “Feather” hitmaker donning a pale pink and white mini dress, hot pink bodysuits, and a chunky white pair of Kiki Ankle Boots that do well to add some height for the five-foot-flat singer.

Yet at the center of the show was the iconic Sack Bag –– which made its first appearance on the fashion scene during Marc Jacobs’ Fall 2022 runway show.

Modeled spectacularly by Carpenter, the bag’s unique utilitarian silhouette, crafted in full-grain leather, is showcased in new sizes and seasonal colorways –– such as the mini and extra-large sizes, as well as hot pink, wisteria purple, and a floral print colorway design.

The stunning campaign was shot by Jacobs’ frequent collaborator, Carin Backoff and was styled by Alastair McKimm to perfectly match the pop star’s flirty and feminine glamour with the eye-popping nature of the bag. Check out the other photos from the campaign below:

Marc Jacobs’ latest collection of The Sack Bag is now available for purchase here.

Just recently, Carpenter has been on a busy streak as of late –– having made her immaculate debut on the MET Gala carpet donned in a custom gown designed by Oscar de la Renta. On the music side, her recently released single “Espresso” peaked at the #4 spot of this week’s Billboard Hot #100, preceded only by Taylor Swift and Post Malone’s “Fortnight“, Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby”, and Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)”.

As we appreciate the pop star’s latest fashion campaign, feel free to listen to Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” below:
