There’s a lot of fresh blood in the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 this week, with Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby” debuting at No. 2, Shaboozey‘s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” rising to No. 3, and Sabrina Carpenter‘s “Espresso” rising to No. 4 (all behind a second week at No. 1 for Taylor Swift’s “Fortnight,” featuring Post Malone).

On the new Billboard Pop Shop Podcast, Katie & Keith are talking about how the trio of hits are keeping the chart interesting and what the future could hold for all three — including whether any of the songs could climb to No. 1.

David Leitch knows firsthand the artistry (and pain) that goes into stunt work. Before becoming a director of blockbuster action films, Leitch was a stunt performer himself, body-doubling for A-listers like Brad Pitt and Matt Damon.

Now Leitch’s latest film, “The Fall Guy,” centers on a stuntman and pays tribute to the skill behind the profession. Nicole Sperling, a reporter for The Times, talks with Leitch about the long history of stunts in cinema and why stunt performers deserve recognition at the Oscars.

“Miss madame’s dress looking so boring like espresso,” a fan wrote.“She has the song of the summer yet she pulled this basic IJBOL,” another fan stated.“My girl I’m streaming espresso every day but this I can’t defend it, this is straight up boring for a Met look,” one fan wrote.



“It’s a cute look but not for the Met like this doesn’t seem to match the theme at all unless it’s an archive pull but I doubt it,” a fan reacted.“Slightly on theme and gorgeous but boring. She should have explored more,” one fan stated.“Her hair looks incredible, her dress on the other hand is a little bit disappointing,” another X user wrote.

“Miss madame’s dress looking so boring like espresso,” a fan wrote.“She has the song of the summer yet she pulled this basic IJBOL,” another fan stated.“My girl I’m streaming espresso every day but this I can’t defend it, this is straight up boring for a Met look,” one fan wrote.



“It’s a cute look but not for the Met like this doesn’t seem to match the theme at all unless it’s an archive pull but I doubt it,” a fan reacted.“Slightly on theme and gorgeous but boring. She should have explored more,” one fan stated.“Her hair looks incredible, her dress on the other hand is a little bit disappointing,” another X user wrote.
