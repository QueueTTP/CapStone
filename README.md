# Starmeter


The user, like a promoter or agent, inputs data on their celebrity, such as social media posts, news mentions, and public appearances. The pipelined data (in real time) tracks how events like new releases or controversies affect popularity metrics. When key thresholds are hit, or trajectory turns toward negative, it means there are changes in public sentiment. A dashboard displays these metrics, allowing quick assessment of the celebrity’s current standing. With this information, the user can adjust publicity strategies, respond to negative press, and make informed decisions to manage the celebrities over-all value by boosting the celebrity’s public image effectively.
The primary goal of this project is to provide insight into the events that cause the changes in public sentiment. 


My MVP : pipeline some data of event, chart it in dashboard with key performance indicator and event log.
We’ll do it using Python, Spark, Kafka, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, AWS S3, Jupyter NB?
